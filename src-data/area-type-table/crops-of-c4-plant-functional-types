    "description": "The definition of \"crops\" is model dependent, for example, some models may include fruit trees as crops. A \"c4 plant\" is one that utilizes the C4 carbon fixation pathway in which the CO2 is first bound to a compound containing four carbon atoms before photosynthesis reactions take place. All trees are C3 type. Grasses and crops can be C3 or C4.",
