    "description": "\"Primary and secondary land\" is land that is not in use as crop land or pasture land, including forests, grasslands, bare ground and vegetated wetlands. \"Primary land\" is land that has not undergone lulcc (land use or land cover change) due to human disturbance. \"Secondary land\" is land that has previously been used for agriculture, urban development or logging and has subsequently been abandoned.
