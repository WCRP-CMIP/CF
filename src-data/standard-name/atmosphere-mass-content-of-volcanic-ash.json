    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used. \"Volcanic_ash\" means the fine-grained products of explosive volcanic eruptions, such as minerals or crystals, older fragmented rock (e.g. andesite), and glass. Particles within a volcanic ash cloud have diameters less than 2 mm. \"Volcanic_ash\" does not include non-volcanic dust.",
