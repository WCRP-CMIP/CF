    "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Amount\" means mass per unit area. \"Sea ice\" means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. An ice floe is a flat expanse of sea ice, generally taken to be less than 10 km across. \"Lateral growth of ice floe\" means the accumulation of ice at the extreme edges of the ice area.",
