    "description": "A velocity is a vector quantity. \"Eastward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). Friction velocity is a reference ocean velocity derived from the relationship between ocean density and downward stress and is usually applied at a level close to the surface where stress is assumed to be independent of height and approximately proportional to the square of mean velocity.",
