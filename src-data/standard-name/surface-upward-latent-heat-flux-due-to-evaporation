    "description": "The quantity with standard name surface_upward_latent_heat_flux_due_to_evaporation does not include transpiration from vegetation. The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Evaporation is the conversion of liquid or solid into vapor. (The conversion of solid alone into vapor is called \"sublimation\"). The surface latent heat flux is the exchange of heat between the surface and the air on account of evaporation (including sublimation).",
