    "description": "The quantity with standard name tendency_of_mole_concentration_of_dissolved_iron_in_sea_water_due_to_dissolution_from_inorganic_particles is the change in concentration caused by the processes of dissolution, remineralization and desorption of iron back to the dissolved phase.The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Mole concentration\" means number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction \"mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.",
