    "description": "The virtual_salt_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_process is the salt flux that would have the same effect on the sea surface salinity as water_flux_out_of_sea_water_due_to_process. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.",
