    "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. Specific humidity is the mass fraction of water vapor in (moist) air. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. In an atmosphere model, stratiform cloud is that produced by large-scale convergence (not the convection schemes). \"Precipitation\" in the earth's atmosphere means precipitation of water in all phases.",
