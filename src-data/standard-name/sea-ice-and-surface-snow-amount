Surface snow amount refers to the amount on the solid ground or on surface ice cover, but excludes, for example, falling snowflakes and snow on plants. \"Sea ice\" means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs.",
