    "description": "The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Eastward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name upward_air_velocity.)  The quantity named tendency_of_eastward_wind_due_to_gravity_wave_drag is the sum of the tendencies due to orographic and nonorographic gravity waves which have standard names of tendency_of_eastward_wind_due_to_orographic_gravity_wave_drag and tendency_of_eastward_wind_due_to_nonorographic_gravity_wave_drag, respectively.",
