    "description": "The construction \"moles_of_X_per_unit_mass_in_Y\" is also called \"molality\" of X in Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". Particulate means suspended solids of all sizes. Biogenic silica is a hydrated form of silica (silicon dioxide) with the chemical formula SiO2.nH2O sometimes referred to as opaline silica or opal. It is created by biological processes and in sea water it is predominantly the skeletal material of diatoms.",
