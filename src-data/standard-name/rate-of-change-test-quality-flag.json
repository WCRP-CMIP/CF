    "description": "A quality flag that reports the result of the Rate of Change test, which checks that the first order difference of a series of values is within reasonable bounds. The linkage between the data variable and this variable is achieved using the ancillary_variables attribute. There are standard names for other specific quality tests which take the form of X_quality_flag. Quality information that does not match any of the specific quantities should be given the more general standard name of quality_flag.",
