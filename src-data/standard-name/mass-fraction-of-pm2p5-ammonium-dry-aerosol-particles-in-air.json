    "description": "Mass fraction is used in the construction \"mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". \"Aerosol\" means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. Aerosol particles take up ambient water (a process known as hygroscopic growth) depending on the relative humidity and the composition of the particles. \"Dry aerosol particles\" means aerosol particles without any water uptake. \"Pm2p5 aerosol\" means atmospheric particulate compounds with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers. The chemical formula for ammonium is NH4.",
