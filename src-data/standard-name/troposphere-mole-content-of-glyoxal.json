    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"troposphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the tropopause. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used. The chemical formula for glyoxal is CHOCHO. The IUPAC name for glyoxal is ethanedial.",
