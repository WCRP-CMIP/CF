    "description": "\"Sea surface height\" is a time-varying quantity. \"Height_above_X\" means the vertical distance above the named surface X. \"Mean low water springs\" describes a local vertical reference based on the time mean of the low water levels during spring tides (the tides each lunar month with the greatest difference between high and low water that happen during full and new moons phases) expected to occur under average meteorological conditions and under any combination of astronomical conditions. The tidal component of sea surface height describes the predicted variability of the sea surface due to astronomic forcing (chiefly lunar and solar cycles) and shallow water resonance of tidal components; for example as generated based on harmonic analysis, or resulting from the application of harmonic tidal series as boundary conditions to a numerical tidal model.",
