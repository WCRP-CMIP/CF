    "description": "A velocity is a vector quantity. \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). Upward air velocity is the vertical component of the 3D air velocity vector. The \"Transformed Eulerian Mean\" refers to a formulation of the mean equations which incorporates some eddy terms into the definition of the mean, described in Andrews et al (1987): Middle Atmospheric Dynamics.
