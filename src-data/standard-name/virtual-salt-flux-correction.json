    "description": "The virtual_salt_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_process is the salt flux that would have the same effect on the sea surface salinity as water_flux_out_of_sea_water_due_to_process. Flux correction is also called \"flux adjustment\". A positive flux correction is downward i.e. added to the ocean.  In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.",
