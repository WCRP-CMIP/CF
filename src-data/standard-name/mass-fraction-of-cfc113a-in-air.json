    "description": "\"Mass fraction\" is used in the construction \"mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The chemical formula of CFC113a is CCl3CF3. The IUPAC name for CFC113a is 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane.",
