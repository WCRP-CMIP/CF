    "description": "The phrase \"magnitude_of_X\" means magnitude of a vector X. A velocity is a vector quantity. The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. Friction velocity is a reference wind velocity derived from the relationship between air density and downward stress and is usually applied at a level close to the surface where stress is assumed to independent of height and approximately proportional to the square of mean velocity.",
