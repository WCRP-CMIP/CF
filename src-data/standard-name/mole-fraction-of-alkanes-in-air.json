    "description": "Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons, i.e. they do not contain any chemical double bonds. Alkanes contain only hydrogen and carbon combined in the general proportions C(n)H(2n+2); \"alkanes\" is the term used in standard names to describe the group of chemical species having this common structure that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. Standard names exist for some individual alkane species, e.g., methane and ethane.",
