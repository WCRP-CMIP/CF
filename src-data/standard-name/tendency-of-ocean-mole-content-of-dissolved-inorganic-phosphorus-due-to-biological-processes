    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase. \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Dissolved inorganic phosphorus\" means the sum of all inorganic phosphorus in solution (including phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, dihydrogen phosphate, and phosphoric acid).",
