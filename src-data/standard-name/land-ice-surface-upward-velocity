    "description": "\"Land ice\" means glaciers, ice-caps and ice-sheets resting on bedrock and also includes ice-shelves. A velocity is a vector quantity. \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere.",
