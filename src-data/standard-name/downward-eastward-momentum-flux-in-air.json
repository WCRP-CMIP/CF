    "description": "\"Eastward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). \"Downward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). \"Downward eastward\" indicates the ZX component of a tensor. Momentum flux is dimensionally equivalent to stress and pressure. It is a tensor quantity. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.",
