    "description": "\"Height_above_X\" means the vertical distance above the named surface X. The \"geopotential datum\" is any estimated surface of constant geopotential used as a datum i.e. a reference level; for the geoid as a datum, specific standard names are available. To specify which geoid or geopotential datum is being used as a reference level, a grid_mapping variable should be attached to the data variable as described in Chapter 5.6 of the CF Convention. \"Top of atmosphere model\" means the upper boundary of the top layer of an atmosphere model.",
