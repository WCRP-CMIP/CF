    "description": "The height in the atmosphere, L, that buoyant production or destruction of turbulent energy balances the shear production of turbulent kinetic energy: L = -u*3 / (kB0), where u* is the wind frictional velocity, k is the von Karman constant, and B0 is the atmospheric surface buoyancy flux.  If the buoyancy flux is destabilizing, L is negative.",
