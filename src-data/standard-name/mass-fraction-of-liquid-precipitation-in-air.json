    "description": "\"Mass fraction\" is used in the construction \"mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". \"Liquid_precipitation\" includes both \"rain\" and \"drizzle\". \"Rain\" means drops of water falling through the atmosphere that have a diameter greater than 0.5 mm. \"Drizzle\" means drops of water falling through the atmosphere that have a diameter typically in the range 0.2-0.5 mm.",
