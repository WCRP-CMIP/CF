    "description": "Mass fraction is used in the construction mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). In an atmosphere model, stratiform cloud is that produced by large-scale convergence (not the convection schemes).",
