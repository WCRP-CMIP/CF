    "description": "Sea water density is the in-situ density (not the potential density). For a rigid lid Boussinesq geopotential ocean model the density of the sea water is maintained at a constant reference density.  In a model using the rigid lid Boussinesq approximation , the vertical grid coordinates (and hence the grid cell volumes) are time invariant.",
