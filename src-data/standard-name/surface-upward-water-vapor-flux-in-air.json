    "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere.  \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward).  In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.",
