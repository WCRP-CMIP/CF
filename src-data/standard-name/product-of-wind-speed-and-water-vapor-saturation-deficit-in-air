    "description": "The product of windspeed and vapor pressure deficit is referred to as the Hot-Dry-Windy Index (HDW) for interpreting fire weather. It is a fire weather index that indicates the influence that the atmosphere has on a fire through wind, heat, and moisture (cf. https://www.bia.gov/sites/default/files/dup/assets/public/pdf/idc-020513.pdf). The units of HDW do not have an established physical significance for fire processes. As a fire weather index, it should be expressed in units of hPa m s-1.",
