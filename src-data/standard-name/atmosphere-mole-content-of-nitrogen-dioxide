For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer\" are used. The construction \"atmosphere_mole_content_of_X\" means the vertically integrated number of moles of X above a unit area. The chemical formula for nitrogen dioxide is NO2.",
