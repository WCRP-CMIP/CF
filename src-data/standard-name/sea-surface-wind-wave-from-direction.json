    "description": "Wind waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the high frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The phrase \"from_direction\" is used in the construction X_from_direction and indicates the direction from which the velocity vector of X is coming. The direction is a bearing in the usual geographical sense, measured positive clockwise from due north.",
