    "description": "Mass fraction is used in the construction mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X).  A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The chemical formula for alpha_pinene is C10H16. The IUPAC name for alpha-pinene is (1S,5S)-2,6,6-trimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-ene.",
