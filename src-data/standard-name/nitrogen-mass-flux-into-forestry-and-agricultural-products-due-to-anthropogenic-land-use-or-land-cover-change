    "description": "In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. Examples of \"forestry and agricultural products\" are paper, cardboard, furniture, timber for construction, biofuels and food for both humans and livestock. Models that simulate land use changes have one or more pools of nitrogen that represent these products in order to conserve nitrogen and allow its eventual release into the atmosphere, for example, when the products decompose in landfill sites. \"Anthropogenic\" means influenced, caused, or created by human activity. \"Anthropogenic land use change\" means human changes to land, excluding forest regrowth. It includes fires ignited by humans for the purpose of land use change and the processes of eventual disposal and decomposition of wood products such as paper, cardboard, furniture and timber for construction.",
