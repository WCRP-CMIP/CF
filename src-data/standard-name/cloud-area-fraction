    "description": "\"Area fraction\" is the fraction of a grid cell's horizontal area that has some characteristic of interest. It is evaluated as the area of interest divided by the grid cell area, or if the cell_methods restricts the evaluation to some portion of that grid cell (e.g. \"where sea_ice\"), then it is the area of interest divided by the area of the identified portion. It may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or any other dimensionless representation of a fraction. The cloud area fraction is for the whole atmosphere column, as seen from the surface or the top of the atmosphere. For the cloud area fraction between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"cloud_area_fraction_in_atmosphere_layer\" are used. Standard names also exist for high, medium and low cloud types. Cloud area fraction is also called \"cloud amount\" and \"cloud cover\".",
