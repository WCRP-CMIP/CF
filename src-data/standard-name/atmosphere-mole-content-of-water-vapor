    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer\" are used. The construction \"atmosphere_mole_content_of_X\" means the vertically integrated number of moles of X above a unit area. Atmosphere water vapor content is sometimes referred to as \"precipitable water\", although this term does not imply the water could all be precipitated. The chemical formula for water is H2O.",
