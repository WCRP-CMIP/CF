    "description": "\"Number concentration\" means the number of particles or other specified objects per unit volume. \"Pm2p5 aerosol\" means atmospheric particulate compounds with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers. To specify the relative humidity and temperature at which the particle size applies, provide scalar coordinate variables with the standard names of, respectively, \"relative_humidity\" and \"air_temperature\".",
