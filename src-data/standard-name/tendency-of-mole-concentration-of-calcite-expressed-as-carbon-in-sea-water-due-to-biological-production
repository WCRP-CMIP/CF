    "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. Mole concentration means number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The phrase \"expressed_as\" is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Calcite is a mineral that is a polymorph of calcium carbonate. The chemical formula of calcite is CaCO3. Standard names also exist for aragonite, another polymorph of calcium carbonate.",
