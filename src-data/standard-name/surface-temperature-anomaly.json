    "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"anomaly\" means difference from climatology. The surface temperature is the (skin) temperature at the interface, not the bulk temperature of the medium above or below. It is strongly recommended that a variable with this standard name should have the attribute units_metadata=\"temperature: difference\", meaning that it refers to temperature differences and implying that the origin of the temperature scale is irrelevant, because it is essential to know whether a temperature is on-scale or a difference in order to convert the units correctly (cf. https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units).",
