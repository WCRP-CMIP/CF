    "description": "Water means water in all phases. The water_flux_into_sea_water_without_flux_correction  is the freshwater entering as a result of precipitation, evaporation, river inflow and sea ice effects.  The total water flux including any flux relaxation(s) or correction(s) is described by the standard name water_flux_into_sea_water.  In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.",
