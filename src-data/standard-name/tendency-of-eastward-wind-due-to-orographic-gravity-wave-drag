    "description": "The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Eastward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward).  The total tendency of the eastward wind due to gravity waves has the standard name tendency_of_eastward_wind_due_to_gravity_wave_drag.  It is the sum of the tendencies due to orographic gravity waves and nonorographic waves.  The tendency of eastward wind due to nonorographic gravity waves has the standard name tendency_of_eastward_wind_due_to_nonorographic_gravity_wave_drag.",
