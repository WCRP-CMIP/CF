    "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"ocean content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the bottom of the ocean. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Sedimentation\" is the sinking of particulate matter to the floor of a body of water.",
