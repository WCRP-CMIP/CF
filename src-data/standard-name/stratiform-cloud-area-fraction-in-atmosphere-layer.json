    "description": "\"Area fraction\" is the fraction of a grid cell's horizontal area that has some characteristic of interest. It is evaluated as the area of interest divided by the grid cell area, or if the cell_methods restricts the evaluation to some portion of that grid cell (e.g. \"where sea_ice\"), then it is the area of interest divided by the area of the identified portion. It may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or any other dimensionless representation of a fraction. \"Layer\" means any layer with upper and lower boundaries that have constant values in some vertical coordinate. There must be a vertical coordinate variable indicating the extent of the layer(s). If the layers are model layers, the vertical coordinate can be model_level_number, but it is recommended to specify a physical coordinate (in a scalar or auxiliary coordinate variable) as well. Standard names also exist for high, medium and low cloud types. Standard names referring only to \"cloud_area_fraction\" should be used for quantities for the whole atmosphere column. In an atmosphere model, stratiform cloud is that produced by large-scale convergence (not the convection schemes). Cloud area fraction is also called \"cloud amount\" and \"cloud cover\".",
