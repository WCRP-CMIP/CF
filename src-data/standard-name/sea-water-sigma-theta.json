    "ui-label": "Sea Water Sigma Theta",
    "description": "Sigma-theta of sea water is the potential density (i.e. the density when moved adiabatically to a reference pressure) of water having the same temperature and salinity, minus 1000 kg m-3. Note that sea water sigma is not the same quantity as the dimensionless ocean sigma coordinate (see Appendix D of the CF convention), for which there is another standard name. To specify the reference pressure to which the quantity applies, provide a scalar coordinate variable with standard name reference_pressure.",
