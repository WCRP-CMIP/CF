    "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Mass fraction\" is used in the construction \"mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". Convective cloud is that produced by the convection schemes in an atmosphere model. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Sublimation is the conversion of solid into vapor.",
