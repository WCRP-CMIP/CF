    "description": "The construction \"atmosphere_moles_of_X\" means the total number of moles of X in the entire atmosphere, i.e. summed over the atmospheric column and over the entire globe. The chemical formula for the hydroxyl radical is OH. In chemistry, a \"radical\" is a highly reactive, and therefore short lived, species.",
