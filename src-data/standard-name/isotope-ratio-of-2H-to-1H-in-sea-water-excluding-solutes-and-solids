    "description": "The phrase \"ratio_of_X_to_Y\" means X/Y. The phrase \"isotope_ratio\" is used in the construction isotope_ratio_of_A_to_B where A and B are both named isotopes. It means the ratio of the number of atoms of A to the number of atoms of B present within a medium. \"H\" means the element \"hydrogen\" and \"2H\" is the stable isotope \"hydrogen-2\", usually called \"deuterium\". \"1H\" is the stable isotope \"hydrogen-1\". The phrase \"in_sea_water_excluding_solutes_and_solids\" means that the standard name refers only to the chemical compound water and does not include material that may be dissolved or suspended in the aqueous medium.",
