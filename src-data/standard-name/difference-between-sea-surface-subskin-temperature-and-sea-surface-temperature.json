    "description": "This variable quantifies the temperature difference between the top of the diurnal warm layer (sea_surface_subskin_temperature) and the in-situ measured sea surface temperature at depth (sea_surface_temperature). A diurnal warm layer can develop in the top few meters of the ocean through the absorption of solar radiation, if surface mixing is sufficiently weak.",
