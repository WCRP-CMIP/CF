    "description": "A velocity is a vector quantity. \"Northward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). The Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow. For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves, experiences a net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation.",
