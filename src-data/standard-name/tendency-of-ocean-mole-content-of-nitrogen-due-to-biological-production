    "description": "\"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. \"Nitrogen\" summarizes all chemical species containing nitrogen atoms. The list of individual species that are included in this quantity can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.",
