    "description": "The phrase \"direction_of_X\" means direction of a vector, a bearing. The direction is measured positive clockwise from due north. The direction_of_radial_vector_away_from_instrument is the direction in which the instrument itself is pointing. The \"instrument\" (examples are radar and lidar) is the device used to make an observation. The standard name direction_of_radial_vector_toward_instrument should be used for a data variable having the opposite sign convention.",
