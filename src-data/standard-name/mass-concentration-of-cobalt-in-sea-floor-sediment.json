    "description": "\"Mass concentration\" means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". Cobalt means cobalt in all chemical forms, commonly referred to as \"total cobalt\". \"Sea floor sediment\" is sediment deposited at the sea bed.",
