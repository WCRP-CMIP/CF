    "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X  with respect to time. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used. The mass is the total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Dry deposition\" is the sum of turbulent deposition and gravitational settling. The chemical formula for hexachlorobiphenyl is C12H4Cl6. The structure of this species consists of two linked benzene rings, each of which is additionally bonded to three chlorine atoms.",
