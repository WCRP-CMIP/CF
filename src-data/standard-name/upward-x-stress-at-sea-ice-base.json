    "description": "\"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). \"x\" indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis, positive with increasing x. \"Upward x\" indicates the ZX component of a tensor. An upward x stress is an upward flux of x-ward momentum, which accelerates the upper medium in the positive x direction and the lower medium in the negative x direction.",
