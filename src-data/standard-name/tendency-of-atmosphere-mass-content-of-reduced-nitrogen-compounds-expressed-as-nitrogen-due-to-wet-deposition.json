    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer\" are used. \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Wet deposition\" means deposition by precipitation. \"Reduced nitrogen compounds\" means all chemical species containing nitrogen atoms with an oxidation state less than zero. Usually, particle bound and gaseous nitrogen compounds, primarily ammonium (NH4+) and ammonia (NH3), are included. The list of individual species that are included in this quantity can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. The phrase \"expressed_as\" is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A.",
