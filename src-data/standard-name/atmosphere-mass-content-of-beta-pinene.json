    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area.  The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.  The chemical formula for beta_pinene is C10H16.  The IUPAC name for beta-pinene is (1S,5S)-6,6-dimethyl-2-methylenebicyclo[3.1.1]heptane.",
