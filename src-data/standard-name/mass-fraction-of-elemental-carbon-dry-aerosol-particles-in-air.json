    "description": "Mass fraction is used in the construction mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). \"Aerosol\" means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. Aerosol takes up ambient water (a process known as hygroscopic growth) depending on the relative humidity and the composition of the aerosol. \"Dry aerosol particles\" means aerosol particles without any water uptake. Chemically, \"elemental carbon\" is the carbonaceous fraction of particulate matter that is thermally stable in an inert atmosphere to high temperatures near 4000K and can only be gasified by oxidation starting at temperatures above 340 C. It is assumed to be inert and non-volatile under atmospheric conditions and insoluble in any solvent (Ogren and Charlson, 1983).",
