    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The content of a soil layer is the vertical integral of the specified quantity within the layer. The quantity with standard name mass_content_of_water_in_soil_layer_defined_by_root_depth is the vertical integral between the surface and the depth to which plant roots penetrate. A coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable with standard name root_depth can be used to specify the extent of the layer. \"Water\" means water in all phases.",
