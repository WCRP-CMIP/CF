    "description": "Wind waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the high frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The phrase \"to_direction\" is used in the construction X_to_direction and indicates the direction towards which the velocity vector of X is headed. The direction is a bearing in the usual geographical sense, measured positive clockwise from due north.",
