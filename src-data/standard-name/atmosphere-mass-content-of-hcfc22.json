    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer are used\". The mass is the total mass of the molecules. The chemical formula for HCFC22 is CHClF2. The IUPAC name for HCFC22 is chloro(difluoro)methane.",
