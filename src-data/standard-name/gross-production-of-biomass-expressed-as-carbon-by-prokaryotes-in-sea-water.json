    "description": "\"Gross production\" means the rate of creation of biomass per unit volume with no correction for respiration. The phrase \"expressed_as\" is used in the construction \"A_expressed_as_B\", where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. \"Prokaryotes\" means all Bacteria and Archaea excluding photosynthetic cyanobacteria such as Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus or other separately named components of the prokaryotic population.",
