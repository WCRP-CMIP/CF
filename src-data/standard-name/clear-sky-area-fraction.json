    "description": "\"Area fraction\" is the fraction of a grid cell's horizontal area that has some characteristic of interest. It is evaluated as the area of interest divided by the grid cell area, or if the cell_methods restricts the evaluation to some portion of that grid cell (e.g. \"where sea_ice\"), then it is the area of interest divided by the area of the identified portion. It may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or any other dimensionless representation of a fraction. The clear_sky area fraction is for the whole atmosphere column, as seen from the surface or the top of the atmosphere. \"Clear sky\" means in the absence of clouds.",
