    "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. The phrase \"expressed_as\" is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Soil respiration is the sum of respiration in the soil by animals and decomposers of litter (heterotrophs or \"consumers\"), which have not produced the biomass they respire, and respiration by the roots of plants (autotrophs or \"producers\"), which have themselves produced the biomass they respire.",
