    "description": "The abbreviation \"toa\" means top of atmosphere. Cloud radiative effect is also commonly known as \"cloud radiative forcing\". It is the sum of the quantities with standard names toa_shortwave_cloud_radiative_effect and toa_longwave_cloud_radiative_effect. A positive radiative forcing or radiative effect is equivalent to a downward radiative flux and contributes to a warming of the earth system.",
