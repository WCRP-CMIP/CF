    "description": "The quantity with standard name tendency_of_surface_snow_amount_due_to_sea_ice_dynamics is the rate of change of snow amount caused by advection of the sea ice upon which the snow is lying. The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Amount\" means mass per unit area. Surface snow amount refers to the amount on the solid ground or on surface ice cover, but excludes, for example, falling snowflakes and snow on plants. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Sea ice dynamics\" refers to advection of sea ice. \"Sea ice\" means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs.",
