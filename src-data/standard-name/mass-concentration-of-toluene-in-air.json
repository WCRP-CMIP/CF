    "description": "\"Mass concentration\" means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction \"mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The chemical formula for toluene is C6H5CH3. Toluene has the same structure as benzene, except that one of the hydrogen atoms is replaced by a methyl group. The IUPAC name for toluene is methylbenzene.",
