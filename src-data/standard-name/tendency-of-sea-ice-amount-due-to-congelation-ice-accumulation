    "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Amount\" means mass per unit area. \"Sea ice\" means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Congelation ice\" means the freezing of sea water onto the underside of thin, new sea ice that has been formed by small areas of frazil ice crystals joining together into a continuous layer at the sea surface. Congelation ice forms under calm water conditions; it thickens and stabilizes the layer of sea ice and produces a smooth bottom surface.",
