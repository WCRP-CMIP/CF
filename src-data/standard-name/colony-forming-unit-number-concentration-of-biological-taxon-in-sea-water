    "description": "\"Colony forming unit\" means an estimate of the viable bacterial or fungal numbers determined by counting colonies grown from a sample. \"Number concentration\" means the number of particles or other specified objects per unit volume. \"Biological taxon\" is a name or other label identifying an organism or a group of organisms as belonging to a unit of classification in a hierarchical taxonomy. There must be an auxiliary coordinate variable with standard name biological_taxon_name to identify the taxon in human readable format and optionally an auxiliary coordinate variable with standard name biological_taxon_lsid to provide a machine-readable identifier. See Section 6.1.2 of the CF convention (version 1.8 or later) for information about biological taxon auxiliary coordinate variables.",
