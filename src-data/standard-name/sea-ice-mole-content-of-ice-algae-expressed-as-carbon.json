    "description": "Sum of ice algal carbon component content. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The phrase \"expressed_as\" is used in the construction \"A_expressed_as_B\", where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The \"sea_ice content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface down to the bottom of the sea ice. \"Sea ice\" means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs. Sea-ice algae (or simply 'ice algae' when the context of sea ice is clear) refer to algae uniquely able to thrive within the sea-ice environment. This distinction from phytoplankton is essential, as several phytoplankton species that become trapped in sea ice eventually perish due to a lack of genetic adaptation or acclimation strategies to survive such conditions. By referring to 'sea-ice algae,' we highlight these algae's specific features and ecological significance within the sea-ice habitat.",
