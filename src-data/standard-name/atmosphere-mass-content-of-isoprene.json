    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer\" are used. The chemical formula for isoprene is CH2=C(CH3)CH=CH2. The IUPAC name for isoprene is 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene. Isoprene is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as terpenes. There are standard names for the terpene group as well as for some of the individual species.",
