    "description": "Wave slope describes an aspect of sea surface wave geometry related to sea surface roughness. Mean square slope describes a derivation over multiple waves within a sea-state, for example calculated from moments of the wave directional spectrum. The phrase \"upwave_slope_direction\" is used to assign a primary directional axis along which wave energy associated with the slope calculation is travelling; \"upwave\" is equivalent to \"from_direction\" which is used in some standard names.",
