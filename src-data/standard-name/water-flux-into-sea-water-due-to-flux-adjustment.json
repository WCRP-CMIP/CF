    "description": "\"Water\" means water in all phases. Flux correction is also called \"flux adjustment\". A positive flux correction is downward i.e. added to the ocean. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.",
