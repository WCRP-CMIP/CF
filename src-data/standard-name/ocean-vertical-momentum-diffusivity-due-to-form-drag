    "description": "The construction vertical_X_diffusivity means the vertical component of the diffusivity of X due to motion which is not resolved on the grid scale of the model. The diffusivity may be very different in the vertical and horizontal directions. Diffusivity is also sometimes known as the coefficient of diffusion. Diffusion occurs as a result of a gradient in the spatial distribution of mass concentration, temperature or momentum. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Due to form drag\" refers to a vertical diffusivity resulting from a model scheme representing mesoscale eddy-induced form drag.",
