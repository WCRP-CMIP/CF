    "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. The phrase \"expressed_as\" is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Anthropogenic\" means influenced, caused, or created by human activity. \"Anthropogenic land use change\" means human changes to land, excluding forest regrowth. It includes fires ignited by humans for the purpose of land use change. The quantity with standard name surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_anthropogenic_land_use_or_land_cover_change_excluding_forestry_and_agricultural_products excludes the carbon dioxide flux into the atmosphere due to the processes of eventual disposal and decomposition of wood products such as paper, cardboard, furniture and timber for construction. The standard name for the quantity that includes product decomposition is surface_upward_mass_flux_of_carbon_dioxide_expressed_as_carbon_due_to_anthropogenic_land_use_or_land_cover_change.",
