    "description": "\"y\" indicates a vector component along the grid y-axis, positive with increasing y. Internal ice stress is a measure of the compactness, or strength, of the ice. Internal ice stress usually acts as a resistance to the motion caused by the wind force. Reference: National Snow and Ice Data Center https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/processes/dynamics.html. \"Sea ice\" means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs.",
