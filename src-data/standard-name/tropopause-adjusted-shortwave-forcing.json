    "description": "The term \"shortwave\" means shortwave radiation. Adjusted forcing is the radiative flux change caused by an imposed change in radiative forcing agent (greenhouse gases, aerosol, solar radiation, etc.) after allowance for stratospheric temperature adjustment. A positive radiative forcing or radiative effect is equivalent to a downward radiative flux and contributes to a warming of the earth system.",
