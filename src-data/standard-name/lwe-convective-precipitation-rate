    "description": "Convective precipitation is that produced by the convection schemes in an atmosphere model. \"Precipitation\" in the earth's atmosphere means precipitation of water in all phases. The abbreviation \"lwe\" means liquid water equivalent. \"Precipitation rate\" means the depth or thickness of the layer formed by precipitation per unit time.",
