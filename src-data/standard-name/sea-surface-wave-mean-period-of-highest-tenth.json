    "description": "Wave mean period is the mean period measured over the observation duration. The quantity with standard name sea_surface_wave_mean_period_of_highest_tenth is the mean period of the highest one-tenth of waves during the observation duration. A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. Wave period is the interval of time between repeated features on the waveform such as crests, troughs or upward passes through the mean level.",
