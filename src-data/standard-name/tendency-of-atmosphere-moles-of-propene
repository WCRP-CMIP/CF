    "description": "\"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time.  The construction \"atmosphere_moles_of_X\" means the total number of moles of X in the entire atmosphere, i.e. summed over the atmospheric column and over the entire globe. The chemical formula for propene is C3H6. Propene is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as alkenes.  There are standard names for the alkene group as well as for some of the individual species.",
