    "description": "Pitch is a rotation about an axis that is perpendicular to both the local vertical axis and the nominal forward motion direction of the platform. Pitch is relative to the \"at rest\" rotation of the platform with respect to the axis of rotation. The \"at rest\" rotation of the platform may change over time. \"Fore up\" indicates that positive values of pitch represent the front of the platform rising as viewed by an observer on top of the platform facing forward. The standard name platform_pitch_fore_down should be used for data having the opposite sign convention. The standard name platform_pitch should be chosen only if the sign convention of the data is unknown. A \"platform\" is a structure or vehicle that serves as a base for mounting sensors. Platforms include, but are not limited to, satellites, aeroplanes, ships, buoys, instruments, ground stations, and masts.",
