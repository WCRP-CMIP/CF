    "description": "Total GPP of ice algae in sea ice. \"Production of carbon\" means the production of biomass expressed as the mass of carbon which it contains. Gross primary production is the rate of synthesis of biomass from inorganic precursors by autotrophs (\"producers\"), for example, photosynthesis in plants or phytoplankton. The producers also respire some of this biomass and the difference is \"net_primary_production\". \"Productivity\" means production per unit area. The phrase \"expressed_as\" is used in the construction \"A_expressed_as_B\", where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Sea ice\" means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs. Sea-ice algae (or simply 'ice algae' when the context of sea ice is clear) refer to algae uniquely able to thrive within the sea-ice environment. This distinction from phytoplankton is essential, as several phytoplankton species that become trapped in sea ice eventually perish due to a lack of genetic adaptation or acclimation strategies to survive such conditions. By referring to 'sea-ice algae,' we highlight these algae's specific features and ecological significance within the sea-ice habitat.",
