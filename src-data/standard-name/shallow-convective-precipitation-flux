    "description": "Convective precipitation is that produced by the convection schemes in an atmosphere model. Some atmosphere models differentiate between shallow and deep convection. \"Precipitation\" in the earth's atmosphere means precipitation of water in all phases. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.",
