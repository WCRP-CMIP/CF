    "description": "\"Bidirectional_reflectance\" depends on the angles of incident and measured radiation. Reflectance is the ratio of the energy of the reflected to the incident radiation.  A coordinate variable of radiation_wavelength or radiation_frequency can be used to specify the wavelength or frequency, respectively, of the radiation. \"toa\" means top of atmosphere. toa_bidirectional_reflectance includes a factor to account for the cosine of the solar zenith angle but does not include any integration over solid angle.",
