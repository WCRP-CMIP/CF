    "description": "Convective inhibition is the amount of energy per unit mass required to overcome the negatively buoyant energy exerted by the environment on a parcel of air.  Convective inhibition is often abbreviated as \"CIN\" or \"CINH\".  It is calculated by integrating the negative temperature difference between the surrounding atmosphere and a parcel of air lifted adiabatically from a given starting height to its equilibrium level. A coordinate variable of original_air_pressure_of_lifted_parcel should be specified to indicate the starting height of the lifted parcel.",
