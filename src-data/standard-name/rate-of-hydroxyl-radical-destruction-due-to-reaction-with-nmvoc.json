    "description": "The \"reaction rate\" is the rate at which the reactants of a chemical reaction form the products. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. The rate of \"hydroxyl radical destruction due to reaction with nmvoc\" is the nmvoc reactivity with regard to reactions with OH. It is the weighted sum of the reactivity of all individual nmvoc species with OH. The chemical formula for the hydroxyl radical is OH. In chemistry, a \"radical\" is a highly reactive, and therefore short lived, species. The abbreviation \"nmvoc\" means non methane volatile organic compounds; \"nmvoc\" is the term used in standard names to describe the group of chemical species having this classification that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.",
