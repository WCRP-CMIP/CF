    "description": "Mass fraction is used in the construction mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). Graupel consists of heavily rimed snow particles, often called snow pellets; often indistinguishable from very small soft hail except when the size convention that hail must have a diameter greater than 5 mm is adopted. Reference: American Meteorological Society Glossary http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Graupel. There are also separate standard names for hail. Standard names for \"graupel_and_hail\" should be used to describe data produced by models that do not distinguish between hail and graupel.",
