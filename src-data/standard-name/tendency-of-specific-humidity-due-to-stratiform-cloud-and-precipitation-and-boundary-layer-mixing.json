    "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. Specific humidity is the mass fraction of water vapor in (moist) air. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. In an atmosphere model, stratiform cloud is that produced by large-scale convergence (not the convection schemes). \"Precipitation\" in the earth's atmosphere means precipitation of water in all phases. \"Boundary layer mixing\" means turbulent motions that transport heat, water, momentum and chemical constituents within the atmospheric boundary layer and affect exchanges between the surface and the atmosphere. The atmospheric boundary layer is typically characterised by a well-mixed sub-cloud layer of order 500 metres, and by a more extended conditionally unstable layer with boundary-layer clouds up to 2 km. (Reference: IPCC Third Assessment Report, Working Group 1: The Scientific Basis, 7.2.2.3, https://archive.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/273.htm).",
