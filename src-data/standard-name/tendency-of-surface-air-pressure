    "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. Air pressure is the force per unit area which would be exerted when the moving gas molecules of which the air is composed strike a theoretical surface of any orientation.",
