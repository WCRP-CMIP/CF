    "description": "\"Northward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). \"Downward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). \"Downward northward\" indicates the ZY component of a tensor. A downward northward stress is a downward flux of northward momentum, which accelerates the lower medium northward and the upper medium southward. \"Sea ice\" means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs.",
