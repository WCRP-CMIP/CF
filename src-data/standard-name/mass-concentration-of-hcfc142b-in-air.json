    "description": "Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The chemical formula for HCFC142b is CH3CClF2. The IUPAC name for HCFC142b is 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane.",
