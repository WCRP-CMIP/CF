    "description": "\"change_over_time_in_X\" means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be defined by the bounds of the time coordinate. The potential enthalpy of a sea water parcel is the specific enthalpy after an adiabatic and isohaline change in pressure from its in situ pressure to the sea pressure p = 0 dbar. \"specific\" means per unit mass.
