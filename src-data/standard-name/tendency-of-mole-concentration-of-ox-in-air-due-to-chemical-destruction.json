    "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. Mole concentration means number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction \"mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The term \"ox\" means a combination of three radical species containing 1 or 3 oxygen atoms: O + O1d + O3. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Chemical destruction\" means the result of all chemical reactions within the medium (here, atmosphere) that remove a certain amount of a particular species from the medium.",
