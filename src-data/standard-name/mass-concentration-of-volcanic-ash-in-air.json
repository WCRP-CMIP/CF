    "description": "Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. \"Volcanic ash\" means the fine-grained products of explosive volcanic eruptions, such as minerals or crystals, older fragmented rock (e.g. andesite) and glass. Particles within a volcanic ash cloud have diameters less than 2 mm. \"Volcanic ash\" does not include non-volcanic dust.",
