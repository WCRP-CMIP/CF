    "description": "The temperature at any given depth (or in a layer) below the surface of the ground, excluding surficial snow and ice (but not permafrost or soil). For temperatures in surface lying snow and ice, the more specific standard names temperature_in_surface_snow and land_ice_temperature should be used. For temperatures measured or modelled specifically for the soil layer (the near-surface layer where plants sink their roots) the standard name soil_temperature should be used. It is strongly recommended that a variable with this standard name should have a units_metadata attribute, with one of the values \"on-scale\" or \"difference\", whichever is appropriate for the data, because it is essential to know whether the temperature is on-scale (meaning relative to the origin of the scale indicated by the units) or refers to temperature differences (implying that the origin of the temperature scale is irrevelant), in order to convert the units correctly (cf. https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units).",
