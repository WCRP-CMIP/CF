    "description": "The construction \"moles_of_X_per_unit_mass_in_Y\" is also called \"molality\" of X in Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen‚Äù. \"Organic phosphorus\" means phosphorus in carbon compounds. The equivalent term in the NERC P01 Parameter Usage Vocabulary may be found at http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/ORGPMSZZ/4/.",
