    "description": "A velocity is a vector quantity.  \"Eastward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward).  A phrase assuming_condition  indicates that the named quantity is the value which would obtain if all  aspects of the system were unaltered except for the assumption of the  circumstances specified by the condition.",
