    "description": "In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Sea ice thermodynamics\" refers to the addition or subtraction of ice mass due to surface and basal fluxes, i.e., due to melting, sublimation and fusion. The quantity with standard name salt_flux_into_sea_water_due_to_sea_ice_thermodynamics is negative during ice growth when salt becomes embedded into the ice and positive during ice melting when salt is released into the ocean. \"Sea ice\" means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs.",
