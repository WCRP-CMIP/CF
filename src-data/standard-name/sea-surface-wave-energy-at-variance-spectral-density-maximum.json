    "description": "The wave directional spectrum can be written as a five dimensional function S(t,x,y,f,theta) where t is time, x and y are horizontal coordinates (such as longitude and latitude), f is frequency and theta is direction. S has the standard name sea_surface_wave_directional_variance_spectral_density. S can be integrated over direction to give S1= integral(S dtheta) and this quantity has the standard name sea_surface_wave_variance_spectral_density. The quantity with standard name sea_surface_wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum, sometimes called peak wave energy, is the maximum value of the variance spectral density (max(S1)).",
