    "description": "Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The chemical formula for peroxyacetyl nitrate, sometimes referred to as PAN, is CH3COO2NO2.  The IUPAC name for peroxyacetyl_nitrate is nitroethaneperoxoate.",
