    "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Amount\" means mass per unit area. \"Water\" means water in all phases, including frozen i.e. ice and snow. \"Canopy and surface water\" means the sum of water on the ground and on the canopy. \"Canopy\" means the vegetative covering over a surface. The canopy is often considered to be the outer surfaces of the vegetation. Plant height and the distribution, orientation and shape of plant leaves within a canopy influence the atmospheric environment and many plant processes within the canopy.
