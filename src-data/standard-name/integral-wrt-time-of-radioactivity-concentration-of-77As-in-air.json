    "description": "The phrase \"integral_wrt_X_of_Y\" means int Y dX. The data variable should have an axis for X specifying the limits of the integral as bounds. The phrase \"wrt\" means \"with respect to\". \"Radioactivity\" means the number of radioactive decays of a material per second. \"Radioactivity concentration\" means radioactivity per unit volume of the medium. \"As\" means the element \"arsenic\" and \"77As\" is the isotope \"arsenic-77\" with a half-life of 1.62e+00 days.",
