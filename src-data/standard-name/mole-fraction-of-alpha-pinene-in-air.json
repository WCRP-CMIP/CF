    "description": "\"Mole fraction\" is used in the construction \"mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The chemical formula for alpha-pinene is C10H16. The IUPAC name for alpha-pinene is (1S,5S)-2,6,6-trimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-ene.",
