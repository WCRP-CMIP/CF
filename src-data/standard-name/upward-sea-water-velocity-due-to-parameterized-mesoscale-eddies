    "description": "A velocity is a vector quantity. \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Parameterized mesoscale eddies occur on a spatial scale of many tens of kilometres and an evolutionary time of weeks. Reference: James C. McWilliams 2016, Submesoscale currents in the ocean, Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, volume 472, issue 2189. DOI: 10.1098/rspa.2016.0117. Parameterized mesoscale eddies are represented in ocean models using schemes such as the Gent-McWilliams scheme.",
