    "description": "Storm motion speed is defined as a two dimensional velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name upward_air_velocity.) It is defined as the average speed of a supercell, and the direction the storm will move from. It is not dependent on the orientation of the ground-relative winds. Storm motion speed generally follows the methodology outlined in Bunkers et al. (2000).",
