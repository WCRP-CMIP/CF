    "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Mass fraction\" is used in the construction \"mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). In an atmosphere model, stratiform cloud is that produced by large-scale convergence (not the convection schemes). The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Homogeneous nucleation occurs when a small number of water molecules combine to form a freezing or condensation nucleus.",
