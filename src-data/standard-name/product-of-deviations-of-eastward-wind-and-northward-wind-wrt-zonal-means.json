    "description": "The phrase \"product_of_X_and_Y\" means X*Y. The abbreviation \"wrt\" means \"with respect to\". The phrase \"deviations_of_X_and_Y_wrt_zonal_means\" means the deviations of X and Y about their respective zonal mean values. The product of the deviations of X and Y about their respective zonal mean values is sometimes referred to as a zonal eddy covariance when averaged over longitude.  \"Northward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). \"Eastward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name \"upward_air_velocity\").",
