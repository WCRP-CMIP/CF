    "description": "Swell waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. Significant wave height is a statistic computed from wave measurements and corresponds to the average height of the highest one third of the waves, where the height is defined as the vertical distance from a wave trough to the following wave crest.",
