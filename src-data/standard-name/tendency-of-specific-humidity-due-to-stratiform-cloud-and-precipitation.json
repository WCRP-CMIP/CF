    "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Specific\" means per unit mass. Specific humidity is the mass fraction of water vapor in (moist) air. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. In an atmosphere model, stratiform cloud is that produced by large-scale convergence (not the convection schemes). \"Precipitation\" in the earth's atmosphere means precipitation of water in all phases. A variable with the standard name of tendency_of_specific_humidity_due_to_stratiform_cloud_and_precipitation should contain the effects of all processes which convert stratiform clouds and precipitation to or from water vapor.",
