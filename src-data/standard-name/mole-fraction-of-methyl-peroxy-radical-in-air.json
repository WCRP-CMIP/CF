    "description": "\"Mole fraction\" is used in the construction \"mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The chemical formula for methyl peroxy radical is CH3O2. In chemistry, a \"radical\" is a highly reactive, and therefore short lived, species.",
