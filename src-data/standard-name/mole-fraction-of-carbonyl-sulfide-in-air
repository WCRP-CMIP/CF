    "description": "Mole fraction is used in the construction \"mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The chemical formula for carbonyl sulfide is COS. The IUPAC name for carbonyl sulfide is carbon oxide sulfide.",
