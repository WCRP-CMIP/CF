    "description": "The depth in the ocean, L, that buoyant production or destruction of turbulent energy balances the turbulent kinetic energy: L = -u*3 / (kB0), where u* is the oceanic surface frictional velocity, k is the von Karman constant, and B0 is the oceanic surface buoyancy flux. If the buoyancy flux is destabilizing, L is negative.",
