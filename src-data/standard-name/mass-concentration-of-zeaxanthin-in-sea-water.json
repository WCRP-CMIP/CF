    "description": "\"Mass concentration\" means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction \"mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The chemical formula of zeaxanthin is C40H56O2. The equivalent term in the NERC P01 Parameter Usage Vocabulary may be found at http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/ZEAXXXXX/2/.",
