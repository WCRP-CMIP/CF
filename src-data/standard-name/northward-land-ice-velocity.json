    "description": "A velocity is a vector quantity. \"Northward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). Land ice velocity is defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component. \"Land ice\" means glaciers, ice-caps and ice-sheets resting on bedrock and also includes ice-shelves.",
