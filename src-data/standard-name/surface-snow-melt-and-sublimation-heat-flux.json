    "description": "Surface snow refers to the snow on the solid ground or on surface ice cover, but excludes, for example, falling snowflakes and snow on plants. Sublimation is the conversion of solid into vapor. The snow melt and sublimation heat flux is the supply of latent heat which is converting snow to liquid water (melting) and water vapor (sublimation). In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.",
