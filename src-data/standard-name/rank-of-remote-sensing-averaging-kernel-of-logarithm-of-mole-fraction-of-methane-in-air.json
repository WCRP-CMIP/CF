    "description": "Rank of the matrix representing the logarithmic scale remote sensing averaging kernels (Weber 2019; Schneider et al., 2022) of the methane mole fractions obtained by a remote sensing observation (fractional changes of methane in the retrieved atmosphere relative to the fractional changes of methane in the true atmosphere, Rodgers 2000; Keppens et al., 2015).",
