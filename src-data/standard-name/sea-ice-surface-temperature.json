    "description": "The surface temperature is the (skin) temperature at the interface, not the bulk temperature of the medium above or below. \"Sea ice surface temperature\" is the temperature that exists at the interface of sea ice and an overlying medium which may be air or snow. In areas of snow covered sea ice, sea_ice_surface_temperature is not the same as the quantity with standard name surface_temperature. \"Sea ice\" means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs. It is strongly recommended that a variable with this standard name should have a units_metadata attribute, with one of the values \"on-scale\" or \"difference\", whichever is appropriate for the data, because it is essential to know whether the temperature is on-scale (meaning relative to the origin of the scale indicated by the units) or refers to temperature differences (implying that the origin of the temperature scale is irrevelant), in order to convert the units correctly (cf. https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units).",
