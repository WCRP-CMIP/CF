    "description": "Significant wave height is a statistic computed from wave measurements and corresponds to the average height of the highest one third of the waves, where the height is defined as the vertical distance from a wave trough to the following wave crest. Infragravity waves are waves occurring in the frequency range 0.04 to 0.004 s^-1 (wave periods of 25 to 250 seconds).",
