    "description": "\"Nitrogen growth limitation\" means the ratio of the growth rate of a biological population in the environment (where there is a finite availability of nitrogen) to the theoretical growth rate if there were no such limit on nitrogen availability. Phytoplankton are algae that grow where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. Diazotrophic phytoplankton are phytoplankton (predominantly from Phylum Cyanobacteria) that are able to fix molecular nitrogen (gas or solute) in addition to nitrate and ammonium.",
