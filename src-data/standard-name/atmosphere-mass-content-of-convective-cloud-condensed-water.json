    "description": "The phrase \"condensed_water\" means liquid and ice. Convective cloud is that produced by the convection schemes in an atmosphere model.  \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.",
