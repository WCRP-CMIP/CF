    "description": "\"Mole concentration\" means number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction \"mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". Phosphorus means phosphorus in all chemical forms, commonly referred to as \"total phosphorus\". The equivalent term in the NERC P01 Parameter Usage Vocabulary may be found at http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/TPHSDSZZ/6/.",
