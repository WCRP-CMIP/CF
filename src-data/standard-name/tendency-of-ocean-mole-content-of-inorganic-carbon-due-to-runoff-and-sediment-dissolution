    "description": "\"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. \"Inorganic carbon\" describes a family of chemical species and is the term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Runoff is the liquid water which drains from land. If not specified, \"runoff\" refers to the sum of surface runoff and subsurface drainage.",
