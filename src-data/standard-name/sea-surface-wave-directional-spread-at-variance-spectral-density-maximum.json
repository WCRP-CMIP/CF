    "description": "The quantity with standard name sea_surface_wave_directional_spread_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the directional spread of the most energetic waves. Directional spread is the (one-sided) directional width within a given sub-domain of the wave directional spectrum, S(t,x,y,f,theta) where t is time, x and y are horizontal coordinates (such as longitude and latitude), f is frequency and theta is direction. For a given mean wave (beam) direction the quantity approximates half the root mean square width about the beam axis, as derived either directly from circular moments or via the Fourier components of the wave directional spectrum.",
