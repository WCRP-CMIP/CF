    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. \"Organic carbon\" describes a family of chemical species and is the term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. The surface called \"sea floor\" means the lower boundary of the ocean. \"Sea floor sediment\" is sediment deposited at the sea bed.",
