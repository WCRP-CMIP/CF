    "description": "\"product_of_X_and_Y\" means X*Y. \"specific\" means per unit mass. \"Eastward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). Specific humidity is the mass fraction of water vapor in (moist) air. Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name upward_air_velocity.)",
