    "description": "In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Surface snow and ice melt flux\" means the mass flux of all melting at the surface. Surface snow refers to the snow on the solid ground or on surface ice cover, but excludes, for example, falling snowflakes and snow on plants.",
