    "description": "The level of free convection is the altitude where the temperature of the environment decreases faster than the moist adiabatic lapse rate of a saturated air parcel at the same level.  It is calculated by lifting a parcel of air dry adiabatically from the surface to the LCL (lifting condensation level), then moist adiabatically until the parcel temperature is equal to the ambient temperature.",
