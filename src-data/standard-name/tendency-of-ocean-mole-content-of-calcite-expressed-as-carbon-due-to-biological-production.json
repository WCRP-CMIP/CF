    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area.  The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time.  Calcite is a mineral that is a polymorph of calcium carbonate. The chemical formula of calcite is CaCO3. Standard names also exist for aragonite, another polymorph of calcium carbonate.",
