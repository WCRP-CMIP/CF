    "description": "The cloud condensation nuclei number concentration is the total number of aerosol particles per unit volume independent of and integrated over particle size that act as condensation nuclei for liquid-phase clouds. A coordinate variable with the standard name of relative_humidity should be specified to indicate that the property refers to a specific supersaturation with respect to liquid water. The ability of a particle to act as a condensation nucleus is determined by its size, chemical composition, and morphology. \"stp\" means standard temperature (0 degC) and pressure (101325 Pa).",
