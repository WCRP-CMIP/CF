    "description": "\"component_derivative_of_X\" means the derivative of X with respect to distance in the component direction, which may be northward, southward, eastward, westward, x or y. The last two indicate derivatives along the axes of the grid,  whether or not they are true longitude and latitude. x_derivative_of_ocean_rigid_lid_pressure means (d/dx) of the ocean surface pressure, as derived by a rigid lid approximation, keeping the other horizontal coordinate (y, presumably) constant.",
