    "ui-label": "Volume Extinction Coefficient Of Radiative Flux In Air Due To Ambient Aerosol Particles",
    "description": "The volume extinction coefficient is the fractional change of radiative flux per unit path length. Extinction is the sum of absorption and scattering, sometimes called \"attenuation\". \"Extinction\" is the term most commonly used at optical wavelengths whereas \"attenuation\" is more often used at radio and radar wavelengths. Radiative flux is the sum of shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes. \"Aerosol\" means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. \"Ambient_aerosol\" means that the aerosol is measured or modelled at the ambient state of pressure, temperature and relative humidity that exists in its immediate environment. \"Ambient aerosol particles\" are aerosol particles that have taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the particles. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.",
