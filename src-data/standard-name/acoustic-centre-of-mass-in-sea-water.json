    "description": "Acoustic centre of mass is the average of all sampled depths weighted by their volume backscattering coefficient. Volume backscattering coefficient is the linear form of acoustic_volume_backscattering_strength_in_sea_water. For further details see Urmy et. al (2012) doi:10.1093/icesjms/fsr205.",
