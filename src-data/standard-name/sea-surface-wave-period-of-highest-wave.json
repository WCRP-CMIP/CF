    "description": "Wave period of the highest wave is the period determined from wave crests corresponding to the greatest vertical distance above mean level during the observation period. A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. Wave period is the interval of time between repeated features on the waveform such as crests, troughs or upward passes through the mean level.",
