    "description": "\"Mole concentration\" means the number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction \"mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". \"Dissolved inorganic carbon\" is the sum of CO3, HCO3 and H2CO3. The subduction and subsequent transport of surface water carry into the interior ocean considerable quantities of dissolved inorganic carbon, which is entirely independent of biological activity (such as organic decomposition and oxidation) after the water leaves the sea surface. Such dissolved inorganic carbon is termed “preformed” dissolved inorganic carbon (Redfield,1942).",
