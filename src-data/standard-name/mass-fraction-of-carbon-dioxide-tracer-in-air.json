    "description": "The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. Mass fraction is used in the construction \"mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". A \"tracer\" is a quantity advected by a model to facilitate analysis of flow patterns.",
