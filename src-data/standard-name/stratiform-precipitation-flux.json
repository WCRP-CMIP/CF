    "description": "Stratiform precipitation, whether liquid or frozen, is precipitation that formed in stratiform cloud. \"Precipitation\" in the earth's atmosphere means precipitation of water in all phases. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.",
