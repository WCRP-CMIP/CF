    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used. The chemical formula for the hydroperoxyl radical is HO2. In chemistry, a 'radical' is a highly reactive, and therefore short lived, species.",
