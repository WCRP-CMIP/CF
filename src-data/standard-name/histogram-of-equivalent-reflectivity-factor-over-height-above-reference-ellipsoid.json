    "description": "\"Equivalent reflectivity factor\" is the radar reflectivity factor that is calculated from the measured radar return power assuming the target is composed of liquid water droplets whose diameter is less than one tenth of the radar wavelength, i.e., treating the droplets as Rayleigh scatterers. The actual radar reflectivity factor would depend on the size distribution and composition of the particles within the target volume and these are often unknown. \"histogram_of_X[_over_Z]\" means histogram (i.e. number of counts for each  range of X) of variations (over Z) of X. The data variable should have an axis for X. A reference ellipsoid is a regular mathematical figure that approximates the irregular shape of the geoid. A number of reference ellipsoids are defined for use in the field of geodesy. The geoid is a surface of constant geopotential with which mean sea level would coincide if the ocean were at rest. To specify which reference ellipsoid is being used, a grid_mapping variable should be attached to the data variable as described in Chapter 5.6 of the CF Convention.",
