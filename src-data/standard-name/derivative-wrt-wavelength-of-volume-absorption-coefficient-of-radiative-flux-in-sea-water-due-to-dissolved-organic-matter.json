    "description": "A measure of the dependency of the volume_absorption_coefficient_of_radiative_flux_in_sea_water_due_to_dissolved_organic_matter on wavelength, also commonly known as spectral slope. The wavelength range it has been calculated over is stated as an radiation_wavelength attribute (e.g. “275-295 nm”).",
