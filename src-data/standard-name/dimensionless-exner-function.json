    "description": "The term \"Exner function\" is applied to various quantities in the literature. \"Dimensionless Exner function\" is the standard name of (p/p0)^(R/Cp), where p is pressure, p0 a reference pressure, R the gas constant and Cp the specific heat at constant pressure. This quantity is also the ratio of in-situ to potential temperature. Standard names for other variants can be defined on request. To specify the reference pressure to which the quantity applies, provide a scalar coordinate variable with standard name reference_pressure.",
