    "description": "\"Mole concentration\" means number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction \"mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The chemical formula for limonene is C10H16. The IUPAC name for limonene is 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene. Limonene is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as terpenes. There are standard names for the terpene group as well as for some of the individual species.",
