    "description": "Biomass of mature individuals of various fish species as identified by their taxonomic name (e.g. Sardina pilchardus) in gram per m3. \"Biological taxon\" is a name or other label identifying an organism or a group of organisms as belonging to a unit of classification in a hierarchical taxonomy. There must be an auxiliary coordinate variable with standard name biological_taxon_name to identify the taxon in human readable format and optionally an auxiliary coordinate variable with standard name biological_taxon_identifier to provide a machine-readable identifier. See Section 6.1.2 of the CF convention (version 1.8 or later) for information about biological taxon auxiliary coordinate variables. Mature individuals refer to individuals that have reached sexual maturity.",
