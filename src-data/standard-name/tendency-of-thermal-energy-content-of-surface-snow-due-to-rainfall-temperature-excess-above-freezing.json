    "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. Thermal energy is the total vibrational energy, kinetic and potential, of all the molecules and atoms in a substance. Surface snow refers to the snow on the solid ground or on surface ice cover, but excludes, for example, falling snowflakes and snow on plants. The quantity with standard name tendency_of_thermal_energy_content_of_surface_snow_due_to_rainfall_temperature_excess_above_freezing is the heat energy carried by rainfall reaching the surface. It is calculated relative to the heat that would be carried by rainfall reaching the surface at zero degrees Celsius. It is calculated as the product QrainCpTrain, where Qrain is the mass flux of rainfall reaching the surface (kg m-2 s-1), Cp is the specific heat capacity of water and Train is the temperature in degrees Celsius of the rain water reaching the surface. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.",
