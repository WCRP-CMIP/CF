    "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Water\" means water in all phases, including frozen i.e. ice and snow. \"Downward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.",
