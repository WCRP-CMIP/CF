    "description": "A variable with the standard name of thermodynamic_phase_of_cloud_water_particles_at_cloud_top contains integers which can be translated to strings using flag_values and flag_meanings attributes. Alternatively, the data variable may contain strings which indicate the thermodynamic phase. These strings are standardised. Values must be chosen from the following list: liquid; ice; mixed; clear_sky; super_cooled_liquid_water; unknown. \"Water\" means water in all phases. The phrase \"cloud_top\" refers to the top of the highest cloud.",
