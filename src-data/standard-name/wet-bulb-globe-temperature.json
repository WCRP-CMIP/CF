    "description": "Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) is a particularly effective indicator of heat stress for active populations such as outdoor workers and athletes. In weather model calculations, WBGT is a derived value that represents the combined effects of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. Outdoor WBGT is calculated as the weighted sum of natural (static) wet-bulb temperature (Tw), black globe temperature (Tg), and dry bulb temperature (Td): WBGT = 0.7Tw + 0.2 Tg + 0.1 Td.
