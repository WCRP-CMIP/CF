    "description": "\"Mole fraction\" is used in the construction \"mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The chemical formula for carbon tetrafluoride, also called PFC14, is CF4. The IUPAC name for carbon tetrafluoride is tetrafluoromethane.",
