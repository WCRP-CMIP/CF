    "description": "This ozone field acts as a reference ozone field in a diagnostic call to the model's radiation scheme. \"Mole fraction\" is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. The chemical formula for ozone is O3. The IUPAC name for ozone is trioxygen.",
