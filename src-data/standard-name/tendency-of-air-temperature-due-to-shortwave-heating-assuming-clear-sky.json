    "description": "The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. A phrase assuming_condition indicates that the named quantity is the value which would obtain if all aspects of the system were unaltered except for the assumption of the circumstances specified by the condition. \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"shortwave\" means shortwave radiation. Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air, not the surface (skin) temperature. It is strongly recommended that a variable with this standard name should have the attribute units_metadata=\"temperature: difference\", meaning that it refers to temperature differences and implying that the origin of the temperature scale is irrelevant, because it is essential to know whether a temperature is on-scale or a difference in order to convert the units correctly (cf. https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units).",
