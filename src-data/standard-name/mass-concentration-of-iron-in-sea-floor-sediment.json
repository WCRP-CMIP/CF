    "description": "\"Mass concentration\" means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction \"mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". Iron means iron in all chemical forms, commonly referred to as \"total iron\". \"Sea floor sediment\" is sediment deposited at the sea bed.",
