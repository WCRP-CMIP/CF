    "description": "The phrase \"integral_wrt_X_of_Y\" means int Y dX. To specify the limits of the integral the data variable should have an axis for X and associated coordinate bounds. If no axis for X is associated with the data variable, or no coordinate bounds are specified, it is assumed that the integral is calculated over the entire vertical extent of the medium, e.g, if the medium is air the integral is assumed to be calculated over the full depth of the atmosphere. The phrase \"wrt\" means \"with respect to\". Height is the vertical distance above the surface. The phrase \"product_of_X_and_Y\" means X*Y. Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name \"upward_air_velocity\".) \"Eastward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). Specific humidity is the mass fraction of water vapor in (moist) air.",
