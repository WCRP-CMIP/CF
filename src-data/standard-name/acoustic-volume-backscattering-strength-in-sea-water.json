    "description": "Acoustic volume backscattering strength is 10 times the log10 of the ratio of the volume backscattering coefficient to the reference value, 1 m-1. Volume backscattering coefficient is the integral of the backscattering cross-section divided by the volume sampled. Backscattering cross-section is a parameter computed from the intensity of the backscattered sound wave relative to the intensity of the incident sound wave. The parameter is computed to provide a measurement that is proportional to biomass density per unit volume in the field of fisheries acoustics.
