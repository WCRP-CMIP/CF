    "description": "\"Northward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward).  \"Downward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward).  \"Downward northward\" indicates the ZY component of a tensor.  Momentum flux is dimensionally equivalent to stress and pressure. It is a tensor quantity.  In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.",
