    "description": "\"Mole fraction\" is used in the construction \"mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The phrase \"in_dry_air\" means that the quantity is calculated as the number of particles of X divided by the number of dry air particles, i.e. the effect of water vapor is excluded. The chemical formula for nitrous oxide is N2O.",
