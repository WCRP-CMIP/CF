    "description": "The great circle distance measured from the tropical cyclone center to the leading edge of displaced convection, which is defined as the closest point that exceeds a threshold brightness temperature at top of atmosphere limit. The threshold applied should be recorded in a coordinate variable having the standard name of toa_brightness_temperature. A coordinate variable with standard name of radiation_wavelength, sensor_band_central_radiation_wavelength, or radiation_frequency may be specified to indicate that the brightness temperature applies at specific wavelengths or frequencies.",
