    "description": "The phrase \"integral_wrt_X_of_Y\" means int Y dX. The data variable should have an axis for X specifying the limits of the integral as bounds. The phrase \"wrt\" means \"with respect to\". \"Radioactivity\" means the number of radioactive decays of a material per second. \"Radioactivity concentration\" means radioactivity per unit volume of the medium. \"Rb\" means the element \"rubidium\" and \"86mRb\" is the metastable state of the isotope \"rubidium-86\" with a half-life of 7.04e-04 days.",
