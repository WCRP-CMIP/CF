    "description": "The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. The water_flux_out_of_sea_water_due_to_newtonian_relaxation is the freshwater leaving as a result of the Newtonian relaxation of the sea surface salinity. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.",
