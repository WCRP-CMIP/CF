    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area.  The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.  Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons, i.e. they do not contain any chemical double bonds.  Alkanes contain only hydrogen and carbon combined in the general proportions C(n)H(2n+2); \"alkanes\" is the term used in standard names to describe the group of chemical species having this common structure that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models.  Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. Standard names exist for some individual alkane species, e.g., methane and ethane.",
