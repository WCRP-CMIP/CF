    "description": "\"Vegetation roughness\" in fluid dynamics means the surface roughness caused by vegetation in impeding the flow. The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Vegetation\" means any living plants e.g. trees, shrubs, grass. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.",
