    "description": "\"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). The latent heat flux is the exchange of heat across a surface on account of evaporation and condensation (including sublimation and deposition). In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.",
