    "description": "\"Sea ice\" means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs. \"Northward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). \"Upward northward\" indicates the ZY component of a tensor. An upward northward stress is an upward flux of northward momentum, which accelerates the upper medium northward and the lower medium southward.",
