    "description": "\"Land ice\" means glaciers, ice-caps and ice-sheets resting on bedrock and also includes ice-shelves. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. The land_ice_surface_melt_flux is the loss of ice mass resulting from surface melting. For an area-average, the cell_methods attribute should be used to specify whether the average is over the area of the whole grid cell or the area of land ice only. There is also a standard name for the quantity surface_snow_and_ice_melt_flux.",
