    "description": "\"Sea surface height\" is a time-varying quantity. \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Height_above_X\" means the vertical distance above the named surface X. \"Mean sea level\" means the time mean of sea surface elevation at a given location over an arbitrary period sufficient to eliminate the tidal signals. The standard name for the height of the sea surface above the geoid is sea_surface_height_above_geoid. The standard name for the height of the sea surface above the reference ellipsoid is sea_surface_height_above_reference_ellipsoid.",
