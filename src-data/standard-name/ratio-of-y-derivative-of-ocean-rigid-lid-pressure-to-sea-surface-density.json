    "description": "Sea surface density is the density of sea water near the surface (including the part under sea-ice, if any). \"component_derivative_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to distance in the component direction, which may be northward, southward, eastward, westward, x or y. The last two indicate derivatives along the axes of the grid, whether or not they are true longitude and latitude.  \"ratio_of_X_to_Y\" means X/Y.  \"Ocean rigid lid pressure\" means the pressure at the surface of an ocean model assuming that it is bounded above by a rigid lid.",
