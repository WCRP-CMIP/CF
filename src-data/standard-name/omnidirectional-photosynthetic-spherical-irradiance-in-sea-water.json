    "description": "\"Photosynthetic\" radiation is the part of the spectrum which is used in photosynthesis e.g. 400-700 nm. The range of wavelengths could be specified precisely by the bounds of a coordinate of radiation_wavelength. Omnidirectional spherical irradiance is the radiation incident on unit area of a spherical (or \"4-pi\") collector. It is sometimes called \"scalar irradiance\". Radiation incident on a 2-pi collector has standard names of \"spherical irradiance\" which specify up/downwelling.",
