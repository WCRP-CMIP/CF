    "description": "The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward).  \"Eastward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward).  \"Upward eastward\" indicates the ZX component of a tensor. An upward eastward momentum flux is an upward flux of eastward momentum, which accelerates the upper medium eastward and the lower medium westward.  Momentum flux is dimensionally equivalent to stress and pressure.  In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. The total upward eastward momentum flux due to gravity waves is the sum of the fluxes due to orographic gravity waves and nonorographic waves. The upward eastward momentum flux due to orographic gravity waves has the standard name upward_eastward_momentum_flux_in_air_due_to_orographic_gravity_waves. The total upward eastward momentum flux due to nonorographic gravity waves is the sum of the fluxes due to eastward and westward propagating waves. The former has the standard name upward_eastward_momentum_flux_in_air_due_to_nonorographic_eastward _gravity_waves.",
