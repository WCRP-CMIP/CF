    "description": "A quality flag that reports the result of the Climatology test, which checks that values are within reasonable range bounds for a given time and location. The linkage between the data variable and this variable is achieved using the ancillary_variables attribute. There are standard names for other specific quality tests which take the form of X_quality_flag. Quality information that does not match any of the specific quantities should be given the more general standard name of quality_flag.",
