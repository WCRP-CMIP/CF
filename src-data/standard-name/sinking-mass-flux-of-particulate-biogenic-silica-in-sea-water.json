    "description": "In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. \"Sinking\" is the gravitational settling of particulate matter suspended in a liquid. A sinking flux is positive downwards and is calculated relative to the movement of the surrounding fluid. Particulate means suspended solids of all sizes. Biogenic silica is a hydrated form of silica (silicon dioxide) with the chemical formula SiO2.nH2O sometimes referred to as opaline silica or opal. It is created by biological processes and in sea water it is predominantly the skeletal material of diatoms.",
