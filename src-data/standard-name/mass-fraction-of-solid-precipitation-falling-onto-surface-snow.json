    "description": "The quantity with standard name mass_fraction_of_solid_precipitation_falling_onto_surface_snow is the mass of solid precipitation falling onto snow as a fraction of the mass of solid precipitation falling within the area of interest. Solid precipitation refers to the precipitation of water in the solid phase. Water in the atmosphere exists in one of three phases: solid, liquid or vapor. The solid phase can exist as snow, hail, graupel, cloud ice, or as a component of aerosol. Surface snow refers to the snow on the solid ground or on surface ice cover, but excludes, for example, falling snowflakes and snow on plants. Unless indicated in the cell_methods attribute, a quantity is assumed to apply to the whole area of each horizontal grid box.",
