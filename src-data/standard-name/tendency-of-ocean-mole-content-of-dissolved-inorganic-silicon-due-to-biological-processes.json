    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.  \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Dissolved inorganic silicon\" means the sum of all inorganic silicon in solution (including silicic acid and its first dissociated anion SiO(OH)3-).",
