    "description": "The Advanced Dvorak Technique (ADT) is used to derive a set of Dvorak Tropical numbers using an objective pattern recognition algorithm to determine the intensity of a tropical cyclone by matching observed brightness temperature patterns, maximum sustained winds and minimum sea level pressure to a set of pre-defined tropical cyclone structures. Dvorak Tropical numbers range from 1.0 to 8.0, increasing with storm intensity. Reference: Olander, T. L., & Velden, C.
