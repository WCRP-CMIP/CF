    "description": "Atmosphere upward absolute vorticity is the sum of the atmosphere upward relative vorticity and the vertical component of vorticity due to the Earthâ€™s rotation. In contrast, the quantity with standard name atmosphere_upward_relative_vorticity excludes the Earth's rotation. Vorticity is a vector quantity. \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). A positive value of atmosphere_upward_absolute_vorticity indicates anticlockwise rotation when viewed from above.",
