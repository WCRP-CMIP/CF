    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer\" are used. The mass is the total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Emission\" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. the surface of the earth). \"Emission\" is a process entirely distinct from \"re-emission\" which is used in some standard names. \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. The chemical formula for acetaldehyde is CH3CHO. The IUPAC name for acetaldehyde is ethanal.",
