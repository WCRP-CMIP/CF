    "description": "The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Tides are a significant contributor to the observed sea surface height; equilibrium ocean tide refers to the long period ocean tide.",
