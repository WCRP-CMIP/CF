    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer\" are used. The mass is the total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Emission\" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. the surface of the earth). \"Emission\" is a process entirely distinct from \"re-emission\" which is used in some standard names. \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons as they contain chemical double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. \"Hydrocarbon\" means a compound containing hydrogen and carbon. Alkenes contain only hydrogen and carbon combined in the general proportions C(n)H(2n); \"alkenes\" is the term used in standard names to describe the group of chemical species having this common structure that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. Standard names exist for some individual alkene species, e.g., ethene and propene.",
