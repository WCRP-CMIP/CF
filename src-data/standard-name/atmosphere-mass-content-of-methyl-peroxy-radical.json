    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer\" are used. The chemical formula for methyl_peroxy_radical is CH3O2. In chemistry, a \"radical\"is a highly reactive, and therefore short lived, species.",
