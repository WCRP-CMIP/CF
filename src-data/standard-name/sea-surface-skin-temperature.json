    "description": "The sea surface skin temperature is the temperature measured by an infrared radiometer typically operating at wavelengths in the range 3.7 - 12 micrometers. It represents the temperature within the conductive diffusion-dominated sub-layer at a depth of approximately 10 - 20 micrometers below the air-sea interface. Measurements of this quantity are subject to a large potential diurnal cycle including cool skin layer effects (especially at night under clear skies and low wind speed conditions) and warm layer effects in the daytime. It is strongly recommended that a variable with this standard name should have a units_metadata attribute, with one of the values \"on-scale\" or \"difference\", whichever is appropriate for the data, because it is essential to know whether the temperature is on-scale (meaning relative to the origin of the scale indicated by the units) or refers to temperature differences (implying that the origin of the temperature scale is irrevelant), in order to convert the units correctly (cf. https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units).",
