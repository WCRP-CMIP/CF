    "description": "Radiative flux is the sum of shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes. Scattering of radiation is its deflection from its incident path without loss of energy. The volume scattering/absorption/attenuation coefficient is the fractional change of radiative flux per unit path length due to the stated process. Coefficients with canonical units of m2 s-1 i.e. multiplied by density have standard names with \"specific_\" instead of \"volume_\". The scattering/absorption/attenuation coefficient is assumed to be an integral over all wavelengths unless a coordinate of \"radiation_wavelength\" or \"radiation_frequency\" is included to specify the wavelength. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Aerosol\" means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. \"Ambient_aerosol\" means that the aerosol is measured or modelled at the ambient state of pressure, temperature and relative humidity that exist in its immediate environment. \"Ambient aerosol particles\" are aerosol particles that have taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the particles. To specify the relative humidity at which the quantity described by the standard name applies, provide a scalar coordinate variable with the standard name of \"relative_humidity\".",
