    "description": "Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. \"Divalent mercury\" means all compounds in which the mercury has two binding sites to other ion(s) in a salt or to other atom(s) in a molecule.",
