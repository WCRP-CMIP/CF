    "description": "The \"Angstrom exponent\" appears in the formula relating aerosol optical thickness to the wavelength of incident radiation: T(lambda) = T(lambda0) * [lambda/lambda0] ** (-1 * alpha) where alpha is the Angstrom exponent, lambda is the wavelength of incident radiation, lambda0 is a reference wavelength, T(lambda) and T(lambda0) are the values of aerosol optical thickness at wavelengths lambda and lambda0, respectively. \"Aerosol\" means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. \"Ambient_aerosol\" means that the aerosol is measured or modelled at the ambient state of pressure, temperature and relative humidity that exists in its immediate environment. \"Ambient aerosol particles\" are aerosol particles that have taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the particles. To specify the relative humidity and temperature at which the quantity described by the standard name applies, provide scalar coordinate variables with standard names of \"relative_humidity\" and \"air_temperature\".",
