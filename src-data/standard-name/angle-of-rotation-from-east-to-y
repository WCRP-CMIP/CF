    "description": "The quantity with standard name angle_of_rotation_from_east_to_y is the angle, anticlockwise reckoned positive, between due East and (dr/dj)ik, where r(i,j,k) is the vector 3D position of the point with coordinate indices (i,j,k).  It could be used for rotating vector fields between model space and latitude-longitude space.",
