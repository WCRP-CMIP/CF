    "description": "\"Mass concentration\" means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction \"mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The term \"peroxy_radicals\" means all organic and inorganic peroxy radicals. This includes HO2 and all organic peroxy radicals, sometimes referred to as RO2. In chemistry, a \"radical\" is a highly reactive, and therefore short lived, species.",
