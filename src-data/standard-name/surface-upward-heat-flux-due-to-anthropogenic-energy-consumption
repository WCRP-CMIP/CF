    "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). The vertical heat flux in air is the sum of all heat fluxes i.e. radiative, latent and sensible. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Anthropogenic\" means influenced, caused, or created by human activity. The heat flux due to anthropogenic energy consumption results from non-renewable human primary energy consumption, including energy use by vehicles, commercial and residential buildings, industry, and power plants. Primary energy refers to energy in natural resources, fossil and non-fossil, before conversion into other forms, such as electricity.",
