    "description": "\"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time.  \"troposphere_moles_of_X\" means the total number of moles of X contained in the troposphere, i.e, summed over that part of the atmospheric column and over the entire globe.  The chemical formula of methane is CH4. Methane is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as alkanes.  There are standard names for the alkane group as well as for some of the individual species.",
