    "description": "The term \"longwave\" means longwave radiation. Instantaneous forcing is the radiative flux change caused instantaneously by an imposed change in radiative forcing agent (greenhouse gases, aerosol, solar radiation, etc.). A positive radiative forcing or radiative effect is equivalent to a downward radiative flux and contributes to a warming of the earth system.",
