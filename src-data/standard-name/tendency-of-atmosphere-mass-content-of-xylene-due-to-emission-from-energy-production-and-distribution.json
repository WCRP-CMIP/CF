    "description": "\"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer\" are used. The mass is the total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Emission\" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's surface). \"Emission\" is a process entirely distinct from \"re-emission\" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula for xylene is C6H4C2H6. In chemistry, xylene is a generic term for a group of three isomers of dimethylbenzene. The IUPAC names for the isomers are 1,2-dimethylbenzene, 1,3-dimethylbenzene and 1,4-dimethylbenzene. Xylene is an aromatic hydrocarbon. There are standard names that refer to aromatic_compounds as a group, as well as those for individual species. The \"energy production and distribution\" sector comprises fuel combustion activities related to energy industries and fugitive emissions from fuels. It may also include any not-classified or \"other\" combustion, which is commonly included in energy-related inventory data. \"Energy production and distribution\" is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. A variable which has this value for the standard_name attribute should be accompanied by a comment attribute which lists the source categories and provides a reference to the categorization scheme, for example, \"IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source categories 1A1 and 1B as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories\".",
