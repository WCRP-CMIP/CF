    "description": "Component of the micronekton that inhabits the lower mesopelagic layer during daytime and the epipelagic layer during nighttime. The lower mesopelagic layer is the lower half of the ocean layer that isn't totally dark but has light levels that are insufficient for photosynthesis. The epipelagic layer is the ocean layer with light levels sufficient for photosynthesis. \"Wet_mass\" is the mass of a sample before any water has been removed. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"ocean content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral within the specified vertical bounds. Micronekton is a group of organisms that range in size from 2 to 20 cm and are capable of swimming independently of ocean currents.",
