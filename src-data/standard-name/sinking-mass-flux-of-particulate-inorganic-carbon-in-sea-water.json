    "description": "In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. \"Sinking\" is the gravitational settling of particulate matter suspended in a liquid. A sinking flux is positive downwards and is calculated relative to the movement of the surrounding fluid. Particulate means suspended solids of all sizes. Particulate inorganic carbon is carbon bound in molecules ionically that may be liberated from the particles as carbon dioxide by acidification.",
