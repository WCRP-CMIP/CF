    "description": "\"Upward northward\" indicates the ZY component of a tensor. Momentum flux is dimensionally equivalent to stress and pressure. It is a tensor quantity. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. \"Northward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). An upward northward momentum flux is an upward flux of northward momentum, which accelerates the upper medium northward and the lower medium southward. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Nonorographic\" gravity waves refer to gravity waves which are not generated by flow over orography. The total upward northward momentum flux due to gravity waves is the sum of the fluxes due to orographic gravity waves and nonorographic waves. The former has the standard name upward_northward_momentum_flux_in_air_due_to_orographic_gravity_waves.",
