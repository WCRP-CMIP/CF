    "description": "\"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer\" are used. The mass is the total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Emission\" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's surface). \"Emission\" is a process entirely distinct from \"re-emission\" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula for sulfur dioxide is SO2. The \"savanna and grassland fires\" sector comprises the burning (natural and human-induced) of living or dead vegetation in non-forested areas. It excludes field burning of agricultural residues. \"Savanna and grassland fires\" is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. A variable which has this value for the standard_name attribute should be accompanied by a comment attribute which lists the source categories and provides a reference to the categorization scheme, for example, \"IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source category 5 as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories\".",
