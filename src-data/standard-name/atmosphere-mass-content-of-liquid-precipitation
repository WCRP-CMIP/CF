    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer\" are used. \"Liquid_precipitation\" includes both \"rain\" and \"drizzle\". \"Rain\" means drops of water falling through the atmosphere that have a diameter greater than 0.5 mm. \"Drizzle\" means drops of water falling through the atmosphere that have a diameter typically in the range 0.2-0.5 mm.",
