    "description": "The phrase \"to_direction\" is used in the construction X_to_direction and indicates the direction towards which the vector of X is headed. The direction is a bearing in the usual geographical sense, measured positive clockwise from due north. The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Downward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). \"Surface stress\" means the shear stress (force per unit area) exerted by the wind at the surface. A downward stress is a downward flux of momentum. Over large bodies of water, wind stress can drive near-surface currents.",
