    "description": "Component of the micronekton that inhabits permanently the epipelagic layer. The epipelagic layer is the ocean layer with light levels sufficient for photosynthesis. \"Wet_mass\" is the mass of a sample before any water has been removed. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"ocean content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral within the specified vertical bounds. Micronekton is a group of organisms that range in size from 2 to 20 cm and are capable of swimming independently of ocean currents.",
