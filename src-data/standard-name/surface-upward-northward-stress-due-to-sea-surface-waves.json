    "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Surface stress\" means the shear stress (force per unit area) exerted at the surface. An upward stress is an upward flux of momentum into the atmosphere. \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). \"Northward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). \"Upward northward\" indicates the ZY component of a tensor. An upward northward stress is an upward flux of northward momentum, which accelerates the upper medium northward and the lower medium southward. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Sea surface waves\" means the stress associated with oscillatory motions of a wavy sea surface.",
