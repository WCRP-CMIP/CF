    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area.  The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.  The chemical formula for propene is C3H6. Propene is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as alkenes.  There are standard names for the alkene group as well as for some of the individual species.",
