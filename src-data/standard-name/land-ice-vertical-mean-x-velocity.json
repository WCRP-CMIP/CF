    "description": "A velocity is a vector quantity. \"x\" indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis, positive with increasing x. \"Land ice\" means glaciers, ice-caps and ice-sheets resting on bedrock and also includes ice-shelves. The vertical mean land ice velocity is the average from the bedrock to the surface of the ice.",
