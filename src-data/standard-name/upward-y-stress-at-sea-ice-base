    "description": "\"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). \"y\" indicates a vector component along the grid y-axis, positive with increasing y. \"Upward y\" indicates the ZY component of a tensor. An upward y-ward stress is an upward flux of momentum, which accelerates the upper medium in the positive y direction and the lower medium in the negative y direction.",
