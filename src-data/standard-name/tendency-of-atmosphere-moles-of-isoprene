    "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. The construction \"atmosphere_moles_of_X\" means the total number of moles of X in the entire atmosphere, i.e. summed over the atmospheric column and over the entire globe. The chemical formula for isoprene is CH2=C(CH3)CH=CH2. The IUPAC name for isoprene is 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene. Isoprene is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as terpenes. There are standard names for the terpene group as well as for some of the individual species.",
