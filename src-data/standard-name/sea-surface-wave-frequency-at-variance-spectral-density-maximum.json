    "description": "Frequency is the number of oscillations of a wave per unit time. The sea_surface_wave_frequency_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the frequency of the most energetic waves in the total wave spectrum at a specific location. The wave directional spectrum can be written as a five dimensional function S(t,x,y,f,theta) where t is time, x and y are horizontal coordinates (such as longitude and latitude), f is frequency and theta is direction. S has the standard name sea_surface_wave_directional_variance_spectral_density. S can be integrated over direction to give S1= integral(S dtheta) and this quantity has the standard name sea_surface_wave_variance_spectral_density.",
