    "description": "Significant wave period is a statistic computed from wave measurements and corresponds to the mean wave period of the highest one third of the waves. A period is an interval of time, or the time-period of an oscillation. Wave period is the interval of time between repeated features on the waveform such as crests, troughs or upward passes through the mean level.",
