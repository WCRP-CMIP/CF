    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area.  The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time.  \"Wet deposition\" means deposition by precipitation. The chemical formula for acetic_acid is CH3COOH. The IUPAC name for acetic acid is ethanoic acid.",
