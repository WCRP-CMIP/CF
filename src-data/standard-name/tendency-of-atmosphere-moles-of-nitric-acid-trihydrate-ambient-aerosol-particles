    "description": "The construction \"atmosphere_moles_of_X\" means the total number of moles of X in the entire atmosphere, i.e. summed over the atmospheric column and over the entire globe. \"Aerosol\" means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. \"Ambient_aerosol\" means that the aerosol is measured or modelled at the ambient state of pressure, temperature and relative humidity that exists in its immediate environment. \"Ambient aerosol particles\" are aerosol particles that have taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the particles. \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. The chemical formula for nitric acid is HNO3. Nitric acid trihydrate, sometimes referred to as NAT, is a stable crystalline substance consisting of three molecules of water to one molecule of nitric acid.",
