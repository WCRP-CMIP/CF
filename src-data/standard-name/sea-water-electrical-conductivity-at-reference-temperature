    "description": "The electrical conductivity of sea water in a sample measured at a defined reference temperature. The reference temperature should be recorded in a scalar coordinate variable, or a coordinate variable with a single dimension of size one, and the standard name of temperature_of_analysis_of_sea_water. This quantity is sometimes called 'specific conductivity' when the reference temperature 25 degrees Celsius.",
