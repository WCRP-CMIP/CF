    "description": "\"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time.  \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area.  \"Re-emission\" refers to emission that is not from a primary source; it refers to emission of a species that has previously been deposited and accumulated in soils or water.  \"Re-emission\" is a process entirely distinct from \"emission\" which is used in some standard names.",
