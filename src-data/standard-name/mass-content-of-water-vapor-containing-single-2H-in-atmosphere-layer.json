    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. \"Layer\" means any layer with upper and lower boundaries that have constant values in some vertical coordinate. There must be a vertical coordinate variable indicating the extent of the layer(s). If the layers are model layers, the vertical coordinate can be \"model_level_number\", but it is recommended to specify a physical coordinate (in a scalar or auxiliary coordinate variable) as well. The \"content_of_X_in_atmosphere_layer\" refers to the vertical integral between two specified levels in the atmosphere. The chemical formula for water is H2O. \"H\" means the element \"hydrogen\" and \"2H\" is the stable isotope \"hydrogen-2\", usually called \"deuterium\". The construction \"X_containing_single_Y\" means the standard name refers to only that part of X composed of molecules containing a single atom of isotope Y.",
