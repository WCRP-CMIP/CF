  "description": "\"Eastward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). \"Downward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). \"Downward eastward\" indicates the ZX component of a tensor. A downward eastward stress is a downward flux of eastward momentum, which accelerates the lower medium eastward and the upper medium westward. \"Sea ice\" means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs.",
