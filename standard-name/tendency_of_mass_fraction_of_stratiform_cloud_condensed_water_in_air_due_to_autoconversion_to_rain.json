  "description": "Mass fraction is used in the construction mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X).  A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. Autoconversion is the process of collision and coalescence which results in the formation of precipitation particles from cloud water droplets or ice crystals. In an atmosphere model, stratiform cloud is that produced by large-scale convergence (not the convection schemes).  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time.  \"condensed_water\" means liquid and ice.",
