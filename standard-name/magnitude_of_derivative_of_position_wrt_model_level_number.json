  "description": "The quantity with standard name magnitude_of_derivative_of_position_wrt_model_level_number (known in differential geometry as a \"scale factor\") is | (dr/dk)ij|, where r(i,j,k) is the vector 3D position of the point with coordinate indices (i,j,k). It is a measure of the gridblock spacing in the z-direction.",
