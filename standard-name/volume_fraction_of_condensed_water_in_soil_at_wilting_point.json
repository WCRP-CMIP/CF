  "description": "\"Volume fraction\" is used in the construction \"volume_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. It is evaluated as the volume of X divided by the volume of Y (including X). It may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or any other dimensionless representation of a fraction. The phrase \"condensed_water\" means liquid and ice. The wilting point of soil is the water content below which plants cannot extract sufficient water to balance their loss through transpiration.",
