  "description": "\"Northward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name upward_air_velocity.) \"Geostrophic\" indicates that geostrophic balance is assumed, i.e. that the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force are balanced and the large scale fluid flow is parallel to the isobars.",
