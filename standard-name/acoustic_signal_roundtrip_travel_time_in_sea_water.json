  "description": "The quantity with standard name acoustic_signal_roundtrip_travel_time_in_sea_water is the time taken for an acoustic signal to propagate from the emitting instrument to a reflecting surface and back again to the instrument. In the case of an instrument based on the sea floor and measuring the roundtrip time to the sea surface, the data are commonly used as a measure of ocean heat content.",
