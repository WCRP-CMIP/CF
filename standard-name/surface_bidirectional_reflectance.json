  "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Bidirectional_reflectance\" depends on the angles of incident and measured radiation. Reflectance is the ratio of the energy of the reflected to the incident radiation. A coordinate variable of radiation_wavelength or radiation_frequency can be used to specify the wavelength or frequency, respectively, of the radiation.",
