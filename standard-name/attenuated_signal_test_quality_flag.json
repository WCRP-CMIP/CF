  "description": "A quality flag that reports the result of the Attenuated Signal test, which checks for near-flat-line conditions using a range or standard deviation. The linkage between the data variable and this variable is achieved using the ancillary_variables attribute. There are standard names for other specific quality tests which take the form of X_quality_flag. Quality information that does not match any of the specific quantities should be given the more general standard name of quality_flag.",
