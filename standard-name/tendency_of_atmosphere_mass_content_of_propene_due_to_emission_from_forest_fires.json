  "description": "\"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer\" are used. The mass is the total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Emission\" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's surface). \"Emission\" is a process entirely distinct from \"re-emission\" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula for propene is C3H6. Propene is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as alkenes. There are standard names for the alkene group as well as for some of the individual species. The \"forest fires\" sector comprises the burning (natural and human-induced) of living or dead vegetation in forests. \"Forest fires\" is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. A variable which has this value for the standard_name attribute should be accompanied by a comment attribute which lists the source categories and provides a reference to the categorization scheme, for example, \"IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source category 5 as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories\".",
