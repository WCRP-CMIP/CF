  "description": "\"Mole concentration\" means the number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction \"mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The subduction and subsequent transport of surface water carry into the interior ocean considerable quantities of dissolved oxygen, which are entirely independent of biological activity (such as organic decomposition and oxidation) after the water leaves the sea surface. Such dissolved oxygen is termed \u201cpreformed\u201d dissolved oxygen (Redfield,1942).",
