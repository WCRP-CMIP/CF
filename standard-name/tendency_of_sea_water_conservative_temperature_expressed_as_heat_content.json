  "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. This tendency encompasses all processes that impact on the time changes for the heat content within a grid cell. The phrase \"expressed_as_heat_content\" means that this quantity is calculated as the specific heat capacity times density of sea water multiplied by the conservative temperature of the sea water in the grid cell and integrated over depth. If used for a layer heat content, coordinate bounds should be used to define the extent of the layers. If no coordinate bounds are specified, it is assumed that the integral is calculated over the entire vertical extent of the medium, e.g, if the medium is sea water the integral is assumed to be calculated over the full depth of the ocean. Conservative Temperature is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in 2010 by the International Oceanographic Commission (IOC). Conservative Temperature is specific potential enthalpy (which has the standard name sea_water_specific_potential_enthalpy) divided by a fixed value of the specific heat capacity of sea water, namely cp_0 = 3991.86795711963 J kg-1 K-1. Conservative Temperature is a more accurate measure of the \"heat content\" of sea water, by a factor of one hundred, than is potential temperature. Because of this, it can be regarded as being proportional to the heat content of sea water per unit mass.
