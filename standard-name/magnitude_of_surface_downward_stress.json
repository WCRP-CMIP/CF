  "description": "The phrase \"magnitude_of_X\" means magnitude of a vector X. The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Surface stress\" means the shear stress (force per unit area) exerted by the wind at the surface. A downward stress is a downward flux of momentum. Over large bodies of water, wind stress can drive near-surface currents. \"Downward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward).",
