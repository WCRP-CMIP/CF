  "description": "The quantity with standard name mass_fraction_of_rainfall_falling_onto_surface_snow is the mass of rainfall falling onto snow as a fraction of the mass of rainfall falling within the area of interest. Surface snow refers to the snow on the solid ground or on surface ice cover, but excludes, for example, falling snowflakes and snow on plants.
