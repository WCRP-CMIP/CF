  "description": "The fugacity is the measured pressure (or partial pressure) of a real gas corrected for the intermolecular forces of that gas, which allows that corrected quantity to be treated like the pressure of an ideal gas in the ideal gas equation PV = nRT. The partial pressure of a dissolved gas in sea water is the partial pressure in air with which it would be in equilibrium. The partial pressure of a gaseous constituent of air is the pressure that it would exert if all other gaseous constituents were removed, assuming the volume, the temperature, and its number of moles remain unchanged. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2.",
