  "description": "This variable quantifies the temperature difference between the top (sea_surface_subskin_temperature) and bottom (sea_surface_foundation_temperature) of the diurnal warm layer. This diurnal warm layer, caused by absorption of solar radiation in the absence of strong mixing, together with a cool skin effect, account for the total temperature difference between the sea_surface_skin_temperature and the sea_surface_foundation_temperature. The cool skin effect is associated with the turbulent and infrared radiative heat loss at the air-sea interface. Freshwater fluxes may also affect this variable (sea_surface_subskin_temperature_minus_sea_surface_foundation_temperature).",
