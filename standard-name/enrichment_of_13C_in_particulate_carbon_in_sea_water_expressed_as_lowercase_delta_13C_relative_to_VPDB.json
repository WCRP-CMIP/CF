  "description": "Isotopic enrichment of 13C, often called delta 13C, is a measure of the ratio of stable isotopes 13C:12C. It is a parameterisation of the 13C/12C isotopic ratio in the sample with respect to the isotopic ratio in a reference standard (in this case Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite). It is computed using the formula (((13C/12C)sample / (13C/12C)standard) - 1) * 1000. Particulate means suspended solids of all sizes.",
