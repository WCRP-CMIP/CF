  "description": "Acoustic inertia is the sum of squared distances from the acoustic_centre_of_mass weighted by the volume backscattering coefficient at each distance and normalized by the total area backscattering coefficient. Volume backscattering coefficient is the linear form of acoustic_volume_backscattering_strength_in_sea_water. Area backscattering coefficient is the integral of the volume backscattering coefficient over a defined distance.
