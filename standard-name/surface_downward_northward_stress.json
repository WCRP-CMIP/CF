  "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Surface stress\" means the shear stress (force per unit area) exerted by the wind at the surface. A downward stress is a downward flux of momentum. Over large bodies of water, wind stress can drive near-surface currents. \"Downward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). \"Northward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). \"Downward northward\" indicates the ZY component of a tensor. A downward northward stress is a downward flux of northward momentum, which accelerates the lower medium northward and the upper medium southward.",
