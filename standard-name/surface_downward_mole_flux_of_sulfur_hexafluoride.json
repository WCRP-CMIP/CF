  "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Downward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. The chemical formula of sulfur hexafluoride is SF6.",
