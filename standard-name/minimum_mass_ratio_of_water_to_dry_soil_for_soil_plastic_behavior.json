  "description": "The phrase \"ratio_of_X_to_Y\" means X/Y. It may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or any other dimensionless representation of a fraction. It is the lower limit of the water content at which a 3 mm diameter cylindrical soil sample will break in 3 to 10 mm pieces. It is the lower limit of the plastic state, which has the liquid limit as the upper bound. Known as the plastic limit.",
