  "description": "Isotopic enrichment of 15N, often called delta 15N, is a measure of the ratio of stable isotopes 15N:14N. It is a parameterisation of the 15N/14N isotopic ratio in the sample with respect to the isotopic ratio in a reference standard (in this case atmospheric nitrogen). It is computed using the formula (((15N/14N)sample / (15N/14N)standard) - 1) * 1000. Particulate means suspended solids of all sizes.",
