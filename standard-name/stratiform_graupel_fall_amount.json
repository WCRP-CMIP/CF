  "description": "Stratiform precipitation, whether liquid or frozen, is precipitation that formed in stratiform cloud. Graupel consists of heavily rimed snow particles, often called snow pellets; often indistinguishable from very small soft hail except when the size convention that hail must have a diameter greater than 5 mm is adopted. Reference: American Meteorological Society Glossary http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Graupel. There are also separate standard names for hail. Standard names for \"graupel_and_hail\" should be used to describe data produced by models that do not distinguish between hail and graupel. \"Amount\" means mass per unit area.",
