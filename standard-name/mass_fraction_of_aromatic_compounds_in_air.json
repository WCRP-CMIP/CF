  "description": "Mass fraction is used in the construction mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X).  A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. Aromatic compounds in organic chemistry are compounds that contain at least one benzene ring of six carbon atoms joined by alternating single and double covalent bonds.  The simplest aromatic compound is benzene itself.  In standard names \"aromatic_compounds\" is the term used to describe the group of aromatic chemical species that  are represented within a given model.  The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models.  Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.  Standard names exist for some individual aromatic species, e.g. benzene and xylene.",
