  "description": "This quantity, sometimes called the \"isotherm depth\", is the depth (if it exists) at which the sea water potential temperature equals some specified value. This value should be specified in a scalar coordinate variable. Depth is the vertical distance below the surface. Potential temperature is the temperature a parcel of air or sea water would have if moved adiabatically to sea level pressure.",
