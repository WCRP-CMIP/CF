  "description": "A variable with the standard name of scene_type_of_dvorak_tropical_cyclone_cloud_region contains integers which can be translated to strings using flag_values and flag_meanings attributes. It indicates the Advanced Dvorak Technique tropical cyclone cloud region scene type chosen from the following list: uniform_central_dense_overcast; embedded_center; irregular_central_dense_overcast; curved_band; shear. Alternatively, the data variable may contain strings chosen from the same standardised list to indicate the scene type. Reference: Olander, T. L., & Velden, C.
