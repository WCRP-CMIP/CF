  "description": "A velocity is a vector quantity. \"Northward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). Friction velocity is a reference wind velocity derived from the relationship between air density and downward stress and is usually applied at a level close to the surface where stress is assumed to independent of height and approximately proportional to the square of mean velocity.",
