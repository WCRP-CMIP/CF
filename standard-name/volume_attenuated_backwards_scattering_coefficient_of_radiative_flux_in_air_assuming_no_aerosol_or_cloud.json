  "description": "Attenuation is the sum of absorption and scattering. Attenuation is sometimes called \"extinction\". The attenuated backwards scattering coefficient includes the effects of two-way attenuation by the medium between a radar source and receiver. The volume scattering coefficient is the fraction of incident radiative flux scattered into unit solid angle per unit path length. Backwards scattering refers to the sum of scattering into all backward angles i.e. scattering_angle exceeding pi/2 radians. A scattering_angle should not be specified with this quantity. The scattering coefficient is assumed to be an integral over all wavelengths unless a coordinate of \"radiation_wavelength\" or \"radiation_frequency\" is included to specify the wavelength. Coefficients with canonical units of m2 s-1, i.e. multiplied by density, have standard names with \"specific_\" instead of \"volume_\". Radiative flux is the sum of shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes. A phrase \"assuming_condition\" indicates that the named quantity is the value which would obtain if all aspects of the system were unaltered except for the assumption of the circumstances specified by the condition. \"Aerosol\" means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself.",
