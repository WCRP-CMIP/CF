  "description": "\"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. \"Organic carbon\" describes a family of chemical species and is the term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Sedimentation\" is the sinking of particulate matter to the floor of a body of water.",
