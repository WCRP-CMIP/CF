  "description": "Mole concentration means number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The chemical formula of carbon monoxide is CO.",
