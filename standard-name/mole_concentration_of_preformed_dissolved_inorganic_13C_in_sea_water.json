  "description": "\"Mole concentration\" means the number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction \"mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". \"Dissolved inorganic carbon-13\" is the sum of CO3_13C, HCO3_13C and H2CO3_13C. The subduction and subsequent transport of surface water carry into the interior ocean considerable quantities of dissolved inorganic carbon-13, which is entirely independent of biological activity (such as organic decomposition and oxidation) after the water leaves the sea surface. Such dissolved inorganic carbon-13 is termed \u201cpreformed\u201d dissolved inorganic carbon-13 (Redfield,1942).",
