  "description": "The partial pressure of a dissolved gas in sea water is the partial pressure in air with which it would be in equilibrium. The partial pressure of a gaseous constituent of air is the pressure that it would exert if all other gaseous constituents were removed, assuming the volume, the temperature, and its number of moles remain unchanged. The chemical formula for methane is CH4.",
