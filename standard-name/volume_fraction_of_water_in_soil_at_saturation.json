  "description": "\"Volume fraction\" is used in the construction volume_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. It is evaluated as the volume of X divided by the volume of Y (including X). It may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or any other dimensionless representation of a fraction. The volume_fraction_of_water_in_soil_at_saturation is the volume fraction at which a soil has reached it's maximum water holding capacity.",
