  "description": "\"Yaw rate\" is the rate of rotation about the local vertical axis. Yaw rate might not include changes to the \"at rest\" rotation of the platform with respect to the axis of rotation, which may change over time. The standard name platform_yaw_rate should be chosen only if the sign convention of the data is unknown. For cases where the sign convention of the yaw rate is known, a standard name of platform_yaw_rate_fore_starboard or platform_yaw_rate_fore_port should be chosen, as appropriate. A \"platform\" is a structure or vehicle that serves as a base for mounting sensors. Platforms include, but are not limited to, satellites, aeroplanes, ships, buoys, instruments, ground stations, and masts.",
