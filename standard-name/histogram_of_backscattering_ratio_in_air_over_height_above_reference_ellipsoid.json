  "description": "Scattering of radiation is its deflection from its incident path without loss of energy.  Backwards scattering refers to the sum of scattering into all backward angles i.e. scattering_angle exceeding pi/2 radians. A scattering_angle should not be specified with this quantity. \"Backscattering ratio\" is the ratio of the quantity with standard name volume_attenuated_backwards_scattering_function_in_air to the quantity with standard name volume_attenuated_backwards_scattering_function_in_air_assuming_no_aerosol_or_cloud. \"histogram_of_X[_over_Z]\" means histogram (i.e. number of counts for each range of X) of variations (over Z) of X. The data variable should have an axis for X. A reference ellipsoid is a regular mathematical figure that approximates the irregular shape of the geoid. A number of reference ellipsoids are defined for use in the field of geodesy. The geoid is a surface of constant geopotential with which mean sea level would coincide if the ocean were at rest. To specify which reference ellipsoid is being used, a grid_mapping variable should be attached to the data variable as described in Chapter 5.6 of the CF Convention.",
