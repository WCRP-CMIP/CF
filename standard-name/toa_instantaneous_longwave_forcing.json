  "description": "The abbreviation \"toa\" means top of atmosphere. The term \"longwave\" means longwave radiation. Instantaneous forcing is the radiative flux change caused instantaneously by an imposed change in radiative forcing agent (greenhouse gases, aerosol, solar radiation, etc.). A positive radiative forcing or radiative effect is equivalent to a downward radiative flux and contributes to a warming of the earth system.",
