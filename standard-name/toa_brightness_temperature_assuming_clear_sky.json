  "description": "The brightness temperature of a body is the temperature of a black body which radiates the same power per unit solid angle per unit area.  A phrase assuming_condition  indicates that the named quantity is the value which would obtain if all  aspects of the system were unaltered except for the assumption of the  circumstances specified by the condition.  \"toa\" means top of atmosphere. It is strongly recommended that a variable with this standard name should have a units_metadata attribute, with one of the values \"on-scale\" or \"difference\", whichever is appropriate for the data, because it is essential to know whether the temperature is on-scale (meaning relative to the origin of the scale indicated by the units) or refers to temperature differences (implying that the origin of the temperature scale is irrevelant), in order to convert the units correctly (cf. https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units).",
