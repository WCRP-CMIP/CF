  "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer\" are used. The construction \"atmosphere_mole_content_of_X\" means the vertically integrated number of moles of X above a unit area. The chemical formula for nitrogen dioxide is NO2.",
