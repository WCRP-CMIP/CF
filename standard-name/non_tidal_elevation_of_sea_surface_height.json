  "description": "\"Sea surface height\" is a time-varying quantity. The phrase \"non_tidal_elevation\" describes the contribution to sea surface height variability made by processes other than astronomic forcing of the ocean and shallow water resonance of tidal components. These processes include storm surge (due to a combination of meteorological forcing of the ocean and interaction between the generated surge and tides), effects of surface ocean waves, and seasonal and climatic variation in ocean density and circulation. The contribution made by each process varies according to the averaging time of the variable as described by the bounds and cell_methods attributes of the data variable.",
