  "description": "Omnidirectional spherical irradiance is the radiation incident on unit area of a spherical (or \"4-pi\") collector. It is sometimes called \"scalar irradiance\". Radiation incident on a 2-pi collector has standard names of \"spherical irradiance\" which specify up/downwelling. A coordinate variable for radiation wavelength should be given the standard name radiation_wavelength.",
