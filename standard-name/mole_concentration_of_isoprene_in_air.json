  "description": "\"Mole concentration\" means number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction \"mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The chemical formula for isoprene is CH2=C(CH3)CH=CH2. The IUPAC name for isoprene is 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene. Isoprene is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as terpenes. There are standard names for the terpene group as well as for some of the individual species.",
