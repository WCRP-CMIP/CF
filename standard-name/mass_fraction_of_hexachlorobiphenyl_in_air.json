  "description": "\"Mass fraction\" is used in the construction \"mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The chemical formula for hexachlorobiphenyl is C12H4Cl6. The structure of this species consists of two linked benzene rings, each of which is additionally bonded to three chlorine atoms.",
