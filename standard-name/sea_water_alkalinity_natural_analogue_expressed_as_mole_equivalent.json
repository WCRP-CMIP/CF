  "description": "sea_water_alkalinity_expressed_as_mole_equivalent is the total alkalinity equivalent concentration (including carbonate, nitrogen, silicate, and borate components). In ocean biogeochemistry models, a \"natural analogue\" is used to simulate the effect on a modelled variable of imposing preindustrial atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, even when the model as a whole may be subjected to varying forcings.",
