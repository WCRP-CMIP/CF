  "description": "\"Photolysis\" is a chemical reaction in which a chemical compound is broken down by photons. The \"reaction rate\" is the rate at which the reactants of a chemical reaction form the products. The chemical formula for ozone is O3. The IUPAC name for ozone is trioxygen. The quantity with standard name photolysis_rate_of_ozone is the rate of photolytic loss of ozone, including all possible photolysis channels to form ground state atomic oxygen (O3P ) and excited (singlet D) atomic oxygen (O1D). Photolysis to the excited state only has the standard name photolysis_rate_of_ozone_to_1D_oxygen_atom.",
