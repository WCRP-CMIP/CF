  "description": "The construction \"moles_of_X_per_unit_mass_in_Y\" is also called \"molality\" of X in Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". \"Dissolved nitrogen\" means the sum of all nitrogen in solution: inorganic nitrogen (nitrite, nitrate and ammonium) plus nitrogen in carbon compounds.",
