  "description": "\"Surface snow and ice refreezing flux\" means the mass flux of surface meltwater which refreezes within the snow or firn. The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. Surface snow refers to the snow on the solid ground or on surface ice cover, but excludes, for example, falling snowflakes and snow on plants. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.",
