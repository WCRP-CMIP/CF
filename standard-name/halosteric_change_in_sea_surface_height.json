  "description": "\"Sea surface height\" is a time-varying quantity. The halosteric change in sea surface height is the change in height that a water column of standard practical salinity S=35.0 would undergo when its salinity is changed to the observed value. The sum of the quantities with standard names thermosteric_change_in_sea_surface_height and halosteric_change_in_sea_surface_height is the total steric change in the water column height, which has the standard name of steric_change_in_sea_surface_height.",
