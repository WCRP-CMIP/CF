  "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area.  \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Inorganic nitrogen\" describes a family of chemical species which, in an ocean model, usually includes nitrite, nitrate and ammonium which act as nitrogen nutrients. \"Inorganic nitrogen\" is the term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models.  Where possible, the data variableshould be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.",
