  "description": "\"Vertical momentum diffusivity\" means the vertical component of the diffusivity of momentum due to motion which is not resolved on the grid scale of the model. The diffusivity may be very different in the vertical and horizontal directions. Diffusivity is also sometimes known as the coefficient of diffusion. Diffusion occurs as a result of a gradient in the spatial distribution of mass concentration, temperature or momentum. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Convective mixing in the ocean is sometimes modelled as an enhanced diffusivity.",
