  "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Downward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). The term \"shortwave\" means shortwave radiation. \"X_direct_radiative_effect\" refers to the instantaneous radiative impact of X on the Earth's energy balance, excluding secondary effects such as changes in cloud cover which may be caused by X. \"Aerosol\" means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. \"Ambient_aerosol\" means that the aerosol is measured or modelled at the ambient state of pressure, temperature and relative humidity that exists in its immediate environment. \"Ambient aerosol particles\" are aerosol particles that have taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the particles. To specify the relative humidity and temperature at which the quantity described by the standard name applies, provide scalar coordinate variables with standard names of \"relative_humidity\" and \"air_temperature\".",
