  "description": "Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  \"Inorganic chlorine\",sometimes referred to as Cly, describes a family of chemical species which result from the degradation of chlorine-containing source gases (CFCs, HCFCs, VSLS) and natural inorganic chlorine sources such as sea-salt and other aerosols.  mole_fraction_of_inorganic_chlorine is the sum of all species belonging to the family that are represented within a given model.",
