  "description": "The phrase \"integral_wrt_X_of_Y\" means int Y dX. To specify the limits of the integral the data variable should have an axis for X and associated coordinate bounds. If no axis for X is associated with the data variable, or no coordinate bounds are specified, it is assumed that the integral is calculated over the entire vertical extent of the medium, e.g, if the medium is air the integral is assumed to be calculated over the full depth of the atmosphere. \"wrt\" means with respect to. Depth is the vertical distance below the surface.\"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. 'sea_water_alkalinity_expressed_as_mole_equivalent' is the total alkalinity equivalent concentration (including carbonate, nitrogen, silicate, and borate components).",
