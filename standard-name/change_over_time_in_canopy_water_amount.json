  "description": "The phrase \"change_over_time_in_X\" means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be defined by the bounds of the time coordinate. Canopy water is the water on the canopy. \"Water\" means water in all phases, including frozen, i.e. ice and snow. \"Amount\" means mass per unit area. \"Canopy\" means the vegetative covering over a surface. The canopy is often considered to be the outer surfaces of the vegetation. Plant height and the distribution, orientation and shape of plant leaves within a canopy influence the atmospheric environment and many plant processes within the canopy.
