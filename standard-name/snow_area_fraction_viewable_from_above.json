  "description": "\"Area fraction\" is the fraction of a grid cell's horizontal area that has some characteristic of interest. It is evaluated as the area of interest divided by the grid cell area, or if the cell_methods restricts the evaluation to some portion of that grid cell (e.g. \"where sea_ice\"), then it is the area of interest divided by the area of the identified portion. It may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or any other dimensionless representation of a fraction. Snow \"viewable from above\" refers to the snow on objects or the ground as viewed from above, which excludes, for example, falling snow flakes and snow obscured by a canopy, vegetative cover, or other features resting on the surface.",
