  "description": "\"Sea ice\" means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs. Axial strain is the symmetric component of the tensor representing the gradient of internal forces (e.g. in ice). Strain rate refers to off-diagonal element(s) of the strain tensor (a single element for horizontal shear strain). \"Horizontal\" refers to the local horizontal in the location of the sea ice, i.e., perpendicular to the local gravity vector. Each of the strain components is defined with respect to a frame of reference. \"Coordinate rotation\" refers to the range of all possible orientations of the frame of reference. The shear strain has a maximum value relative to one of these orientations. The second invariant of strain rate, often referred to as the maximum shear strain [rate], is the maximum over coordinate rotations of the shear strain rate.",
