  "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer\" are used. \"Emission\" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's surface). The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Emission\" is a process entirely distinct from \"re-emission\" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula for toluene is C6H5CH3. Toluene has the same structure as benzene, except that one of the hydrogen atoms is replaced by a methyl group. The IUPAC name for toluene is methylbenzene.",
