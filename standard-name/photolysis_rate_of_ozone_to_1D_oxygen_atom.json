  "description": "\"Photolysis\" is a chemical reaction in which a chemical compound is broken down by photons. The \"reaction rate\" is the rate at which the reactants of a chemical reaction form the products. The chemical formula for ozone is O3. The IUPAC name for ozone is trioxygen. \"1D oxygen atom\" means the singlet D state, an excited state, of the oxygen atom. The combined photolysis rate of ozone to both excited and ground state oxygen atoms has the standard name photolysis_rate_of_ozone.",
