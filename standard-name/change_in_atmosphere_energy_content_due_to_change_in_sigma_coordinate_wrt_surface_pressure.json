  "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"wrt\" means with respect to. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used. \"Atmosphere energy content\" has not yet been precisely defined! Please express your views on this quantity on the CF email list. See Appendix D of the CF convention for information about parametric vertical coordinates.",
