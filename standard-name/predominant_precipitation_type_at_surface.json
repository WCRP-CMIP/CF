  "description": "A variable with the standard name predominant_precipitation_type_at_surface contains strings which indicate the character of the predominant precipitating hydrometeor at a location or grid cell. These strings have not yet been standardised. Alternatively, the data variable may contain integers which can be translated to strings using flag_values and flag_meanings attributes. \"Precipitation\" in the earth's atmosphere means precipitation of water in all phases. The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere.",
