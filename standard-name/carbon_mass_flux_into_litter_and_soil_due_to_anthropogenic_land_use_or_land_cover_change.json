  "description": "In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. \"Litter\" is dead plant material in or above the soil. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Anthropogenic\" means influenced, caused, or created by human activity. \"Anthropogenic land use change\" means human changes to land, excluding forest regrowth.
