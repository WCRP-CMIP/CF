  "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. Downwelling radiation is radiation from above. It does not mean \"net downward\". The sign convention is that \"upwelling\" is positive upwards and \"downwelling\" is positive downwards. A coordinate variable for radiation wavelength should be given the standard name radiation_wavelength. Photon spherical irradiance is the photon flux incident on unit area of a hemispherical (or \"2-pi\") collector. The direction (\"up/downwelling\") is specified. Radiation incident on a 4-pi collector has a standard name referring to \"omnidirectional spherical irradiance\". A photon flux is specified in terms of numbers of photons expressed in moles.",
