  "description": "The ocean mixed layer is the upper part of the ocean, regarded as being well-mixed. The base of the mixed layer defined by \"temperature\", \"sigma\", \"sigma_theta\", \"sigma_t\" or vertical diffusivity is the level at which the quantity indicated differs from its surface value by a certain amount. A coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable with standard name sea_water_temperature_difference can be used to specify the temperature criterion that determines the layer thickness. Sea water temperature is the in situ temperature of the sea water. \"Thickness\" means the vertical extent of a layer.",
