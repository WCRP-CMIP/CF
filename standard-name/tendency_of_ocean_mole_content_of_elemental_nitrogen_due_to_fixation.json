  "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"ocean content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the bottom of the ocean. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Nitrogen fixation\" means the production of ammonia from nitrogen gas. Organisms that fix nitrogen are termed \"diazotrophs\". Diazotrophic phytoplankton can fix atmospheric nitrogen, thus increasing the content of nitrogen in the ocean.",
