  "description": "\"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time.  \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area.  \"Emission\" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's surface).  \"Emission\" is a process entirely distinct from \"re-emission\" which is used in some standard names.",
