  "description": "Mass fraction is used in the construction mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). \"Aerosol\" means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. Aerosol takes up ambient water (a process known as hygroscopic growth) depending on the relative humidity and the composition of the aerosol. \"Dry aerosol particles\" means aerosol particles without any water uptake. \"Primary particulate organic matter \" means all organic matter emitted directly to the atmosphere as particles except elemental carbon. The sum of primary_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol and secondary_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol is particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol.",
