  "description": "The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Eastward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward).  \"Eliassen Palm flux\" is a widely used vector in the meridional plane, and the divergence of this flux appears as a forcing in the Transformed Eulerian mean formulation of the zonal mean zonal wind equation.  Thus, \"eastward_wind\" here will generally be the zonally averaged eastward wind.",
