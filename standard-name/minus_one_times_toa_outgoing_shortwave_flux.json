  "description": "\"Minus one times\" means that the quantity described takes the opposite sign convention  to that for the quantity which has the same standard name apart from this phrase, i.e. the two quantities differ from one another by a factor of -1.  Shortwave means shortwave radiation. \"toa\" means top of atmosphere. The TOA outgoing shortwave flux is the reflected and scattered solar radiative flux i.e. the \"upwelling\" TOA shortwave flux, sometimes called the \"outgoing shortwave radiation\" or \"OSR\". In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.",
