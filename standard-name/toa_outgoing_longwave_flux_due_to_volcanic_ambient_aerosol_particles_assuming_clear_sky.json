  "description": "\"toa\" means top of atmosphere. The term \"longwave\" means longwave radiation. The TOA outgoing longwave flux is the upwelling thermal radiative flux, often called the \"outgoing longwave radiation\" or \"OLR\". In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Aerosol\" means the system of suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets) and their carrier gas, the air itself. \"Ambient_aerosol\" means that the aerosol is measured or modelled at the ambient state of pressure, temperature and relative humidity that exists in its immediate environment. \"Ambient aerosol particles\" are aerosol particles that have taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the particles. To specify the relative humidity and temperature at which the quantity described by the standard name applies, provide scalar coordinate variables with standard names of \"relative_humidity\" and \"air_temperature\". Volcanic aerosols include both volcanic ash and secondary products such as sulphate aerosols formed from gaseous emissions of volcanic eruptions. A phrase \"assuming_condition\" indicates that the named quantity is the value which would obtain if all aspects of the system were unaltered except for the assumption of the circumstances specified by the condition.",
