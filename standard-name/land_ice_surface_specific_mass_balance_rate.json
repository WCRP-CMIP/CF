  "description": "\"Land ice\" means glaciers, ice-caps and ice-sheets resting on bedrock and also includes ice-shelves. Specific mass balance means the net rate at which ice is added at the land ice surface due to all processes of surface accumulation and ablation. A negative value means loss of ice.",
