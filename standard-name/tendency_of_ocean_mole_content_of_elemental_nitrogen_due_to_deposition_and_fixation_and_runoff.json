  "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"ocean content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the bottom of the ocean. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Deposition of nitrogen into the ocean is the sum of dry and wet deposition of nitrogen species onto the ocean surface from the atmosphere. \"Nitrogen fixation\" means the production of ammonia from nitrogen gas. Organisms that fix nitrogen are termed \"diazotrophs\". Diazotrophic phytoplankton can fix atmospheric nitrogen, thus increasing the content of nitrogen in the ocean. Runoff is the liquid water which drains from land. If not specified, \"runoff\" refers to the sum of surface runoff and subsurface drainage.",
