  "description": "\"Mass concentration\" means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction \"mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The phrase \"expressed_as\" is used in the construction \"A_expressed_as_B\", where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. Mass concentration of biota expressed as carbon is also referred to as \"carbon biomass\". \"Biological taxon\" is a name or other label identifying an organism or a group of organisms as belonging to a unit of classification in a hierarchical taxonomy. There must be an auxiliary coordinate variable with standard name biological_taxon_name to identify the taxon in human readable format and optionally an auxiliary coordinate variable with standard name biological_taxon_lsid to provide a machine-readable identifier. See Section 6.1.2 of the CF convention (version 1.8 or later) for information about biological taxon auxiliary coordinate variables.",
