  "description": "A velocity is a vector quantity. \"Northward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Due to tides\" means due to all astronomical gravity changes which manifest as tides.
