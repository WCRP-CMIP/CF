  "description": "Mole fraction is used in the construction \"mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". \"Artificial tracer\" means a passive atmospheric tracer that is used to study atmospheric transport and deposition. To specify the length of the tracer lifetime in the atmosphere, a scalar coordinate variable with the standard name of tracer_lifetime should be used.",
