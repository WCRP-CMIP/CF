  "description": "\"Mass fraction\" is used in the construction \"mass_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. It means the ratio of the mass of X to the mass of Y (including X). A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The chemical formula for xylene is C6H4C2H6. In chemistry, xylene is a generic term for a group of three isomers of dimethylbenzene. The IUPAC names for the isomers are 1,2-dimethylbenzene, 1,3-dimethylbenzene and 1,4-dimethylbenzene. Xylene is an aromatic hydrocarbon. There are standard names that refer to aromatic compounds as a group, as well as those for individual species.",
