  "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. The chemical formula for methane is CH4. The mass is the total mass of the molecules. The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Emission\" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. the surface of the earth). \"Emission\" is a process entirely distinct from \"re-emission\" which is used in some standard names. Wetlands are areas where water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season. The precise conditions under which wetlands produce and consume methane can vary between models.",
