  "description": "The phrase \"change_over_time_in_X\" means change in a quantity X over a time interval, which should be defined by the bounds of the time coordinate. Sea water potential density is the density a parcel of sea water would have if moved adiabatically to a reference pressure, by default assumed to be sea level pressure. To specify the reference pressure to which the quantity applies, provide a scalar coordinate variable with standard name reference_pressure. The density of a substance is its mass per unit volume. For sea water potential density, if 1000 kg m-3 is subtracted, the standard name \"sea_water_sigma_theta\" should be chosen instead.",
