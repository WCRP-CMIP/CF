  "description": "\"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). A net upward flux is the difference between the flux from below (upward) and the flux from above (downward). In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. The chemical formula for methane is CH4. Methane is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as alkanes. There are standard names for the alkane group as well as for some of the individual species. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Emission\" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. the surface of the earth). \"Emission\" is a process entirely distinct from \"re-emission\" which is used in some standard names. Wetlands are areas where water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season. The precise conditions under which wetlands produce and consume methane can vary between models. The quantity with standard name surface_net_upward_mass_flux_of_methane_due_to_emission_from_wetland_biological_processes is the difference between the upward and downward surface fluxes of methane which have standard names surface_upward_mass_flux_of_methane_due_to_emission_from_wetland_biological_production and surface_downward_mass_flux_of_methane_due_to_wetland_biological_consumption, respectively.",
