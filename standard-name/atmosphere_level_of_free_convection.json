  "description": "The level of free convection is the altitude where the temperature of the environment decreases faster than the moist adiabatic lapse rate of a saturated air parcel at the same level.  It is calculated by lifting a parcel of air dry adiabatically to the LCL (lifted condensation level), then moist adiabatically until the parcel temperature is equal to the ambient temperature. A coordinate variable of original_air_pressure_of_lifted_parcel should be specified to indicate the starting height of the lifted parcel.",
