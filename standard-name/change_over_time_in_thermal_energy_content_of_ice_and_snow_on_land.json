  "description": "The phrase \"change_over_time_in_X\" means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be defined by the bounds of the time coordinate. Thermal energy is the total vibrational energy, kinetic and potential, of all the molecules and atoms in a substance. The phrase \"ice_and_snow_on_land\" means ice in glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets and shelves, river and lake ice, any other ice on a land surface, such as frozen flood water, and snow lying on such ice or on the land surface.",
