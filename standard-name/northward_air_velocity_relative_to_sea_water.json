  "description": "The northward motion of air, relative to near-surface northward current; calculated as northward_wind minus northward_sea_water_velocity. A vertical coordinate variable or scalar coordinate with standard name \"depth\" should be used to indicate the depth of sea water velocity used in the calculation. Similarly, a vertical coordinate variable or scalar coordinate with standard name \"height\" should be used to indicate the height of the the wind component. A velocity is a vector quantity. \"Northward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward).",
