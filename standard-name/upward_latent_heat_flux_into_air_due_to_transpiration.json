  "description": "\"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Transpiration is the process by which liquid water in plant stomata is transferred as water vapor into the atmosphere. The latent heat flux due to transpiration is the release of latent heat from plant surfaces to the air due to the release of water vapor.",
