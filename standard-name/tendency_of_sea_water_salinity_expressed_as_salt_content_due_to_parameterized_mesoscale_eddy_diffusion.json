  "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. Parameterized mesoscale eddy diffusive processes include diffusion along neutral directions in the interior of the ocean and horizontal diffusion in the surface boundary layer. The processes occur on a spatial scale of many tens of kilometres and an evolutionary time of weeks.",
