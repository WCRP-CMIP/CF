  "description": "Acoustic index of aggregation is the depth integral of squared volume backscattering coefficient divided by the squared area backscattering coefficient. Volume backscattering coefficient is the linear form of acoustic_volume_backscattering_strength_in_sea_water. Area backscattering coefficient is the integral of the volume backscattering coefficient over a defined distance. The parameter is computed to provide a value that represents the patchiness of biomass in the water column in the field of fisheries acoustics - the value is high when small areas are much denser than the rest of the distribution. The parameter is also the reciprocal of acoustic_equivalent_area_in_sea_water.
