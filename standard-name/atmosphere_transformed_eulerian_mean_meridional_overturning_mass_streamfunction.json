  "description": "The \"meridional mass streamfunction\" is a streamfunction of the zonally averaged mass transport in the meridional plane. The \"Transformed Eulerian Mean\" refers to a formulation of the mean equations which incorporates some eddy terms into the definition of the mean, described in Andrews et al (1987): Middle Atmospheric Dynamics.
