  "description": "Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air, not the surface (skin) temperature. The quantity with standard name heat_index_of_air_temperature is the perceived air temperature when relative humidity is taken into consideration (which makes it feel hotter than the actual air temperature). Heat index is only defined when the ambient air temperature is at or above 299.817 K. References: https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat-index; WMO codes registry entry http://codes.wmo.int/grib2/codeflag/4.2/_0-0-12. It is strongly recommended that a variable with this standard name should have a units_metadata attribute, with one of the values \"on-scale\" or \"difference\", whichever is appropriate for the data, because it is essential to know whether the temperature is on-scale (meaning relative to the origin of the scale indicated by the units) or refers to temperature differences (implying that the origin of the temperature scale is irrevelant), in order to convert the units correctly (cf. https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units).",
