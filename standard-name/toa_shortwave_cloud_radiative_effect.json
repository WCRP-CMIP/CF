  "description": "The abbreviation \"toa\" means top of atmosphere. The term \"shortwave\" means shortwave radiation. Cloud radiative effect is also commonly known as \"cloud radiative forcing\". It is the difference in radiative flux resulting from the presence of clouds. A positive radiative forcing or radiative effect is equivalent to a downward radiative flux and contributes to a warming of the earth system. The quantity with standard name toa_shortwave_cloud_radiative_effect is the difference between those with standard names toa_net_downward_shortwave_flux and toa_net_downward_shortwave_flux_assuming_clear_sky.",
