  "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. sea_water_alkalinity_expressed_as_mole_equivalent is the total alkalinity equivalent concentration (including carbonate, nitrogen, silicate, and borate components). The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.",
