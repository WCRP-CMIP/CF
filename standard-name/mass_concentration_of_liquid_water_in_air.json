  "description": "Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction \"mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". The mass concentration of liquid water takes into account all cloud droplets and liquid precipitation regardless of drop size or fall speed.",
