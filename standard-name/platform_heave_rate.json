  "description": "\"Heave rate\" is the rate of displacement along the local vertical axis. Heave rate might not include changes to the \"at rest\" position of the platform with respect to the axis of displacement, which may change over time. The standard name platform_heave_rate should be chosen only if the sign convention of the data is unknown. For cases where the sign convention of the heave rate is known, a standard name of platform_heave_rate_down or platform_heave_rate_up should be chosen, as appropriate. A \"platform\" is a structure or vehicle that serves as a base for mounting sensors. Platforms include, but are not limited to, satellites, aeroplanes, ships, buoys, instruments, ground stations, and masts.",
