  "description": "\"Thickness\" means the vertical extent of a layer. The ocean mixed layer is the upper part of the ocean, regarded as being well-mixed. The base of the mixed layer defined by temperature, sigma, sigma_theta, or vertical diffusivity is the level at which the quantity indicated differs from its surface value by a certain amount. The amount by which the quantity differs can be specified by a scalar coordinate variable.",
