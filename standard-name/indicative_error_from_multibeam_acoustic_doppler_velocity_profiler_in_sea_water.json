  "description": "Sea water velocity is a vector quantity that is the speed at which water travels in a specified direction. The \"indicative error\" is an estimate of the quality of a sea water velocity profile measured using an ADCP (acoustic doppler current profiler). It is determined by the difference between the vertical velocity calculated from two 3-beam solutions. The parameter is frequently referred to as the \"error velocity\".",
