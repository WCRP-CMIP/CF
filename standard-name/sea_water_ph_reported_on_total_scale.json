  "description": "'sea_water_pH_reported_on_total_scale' is the measure of acidity of seawater, defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of dissolved hydrogen ions plus bisulfate ions in a sea water medium; it can be measured or calculated; when measured the scale is defined according to a series of buffers prepared in artificial seawater containing bisulfate.  The quantity may be written as pH(total) = -log([H+](free) + [HSO4-]).",
