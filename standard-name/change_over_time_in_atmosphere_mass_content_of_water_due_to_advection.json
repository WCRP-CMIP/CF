  "description": "\"change_over_time_in_X\" means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be defined by the bounds of the time coordinate.  \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area.  The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.  \"Water\" means water in all phases.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.",
