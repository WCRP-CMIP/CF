  "description": "The quantity with standard name sea_surface_tertiary_swell_wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum is the energy of the most energetic waves within the tertiary swell wave component of a sea. Swell waves are waves on the ocean surface and are the low frequency portion of a bimodal wave frequency spectrum. The tertiary swell wave is the third most energetic swell wave. The phrase \"wave_energy_at_variance_spectral_density_maximum\", sometimes called peak wave energy, describes the maximum value of the wave_variance_spectral_density within a given sub-domain of the wave spectrum.",
