  "description": "\"stp\" means standard temperature (0 degC) and pressure (101325 Pa). \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used. The equivalent thickness at STP of a particular constituent of the atmosphere is the thickness of the layer that the gas would occupy if it was separated from the other constituents and gathered together at STP. equivalent_thickness_at_stp_of_atmosphere_ozone_content is usually measured in Dobson Units which are equivalent to 446.2 micromoles m-2 or an equivalent thickness at STP of 10 micrometers. N.B. Data variables containing column content of ozone can be given the standard name of either equivalent_thickness_at_stp_of_atmosphere_ozone_content or atmosphere_mole_content_of_ozone. The latter name is recommended for consistency with mole content names for chemical species other than ozone.",
