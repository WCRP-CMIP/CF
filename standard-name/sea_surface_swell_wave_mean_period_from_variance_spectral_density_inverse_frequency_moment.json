  "description": "The swell wave directional spectrum can be written as a  five dimensional function S(t,x,y,f,theta) where t is time, x and y are horizontal coordinates (such as longitude and latitude), f is frequency and theta is direction.  S can be integrated over direction to give  S1= integral(S dtheta).  Frequency moments, M(n) of S1 can then be calculated as follows: M(n) = integral(S1 f^n df), where f^n is f to the power of n.  The inverse wave period, T(m-1), is calculated as the ratio M(-1)/M(0).",
