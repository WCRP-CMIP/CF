  "description": "\"x\" indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis, when this is not true longitude, positive with increasing x. Angular projection coordinates are angular distances in the x- and y-directions on a plane onto which the surface of the Earth has been projected according to a map projection. The relationship between the angular projection coordinates and latitude and longitude is described by the grid_mapping.",
