  "description": "The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Eastward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward).  The total tendency of the eastward wind will include a variety of numerical and diffusive effects: a variable with this standard name is sometimes needed to allow the momentum budget to be closed.",
