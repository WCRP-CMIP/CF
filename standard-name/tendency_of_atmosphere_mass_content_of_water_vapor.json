  "description": "\"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used. Atmosphere water vapor content is sometimes referred to as \"precipitable water\", although this term does not imply the water could all be precipitated.",
