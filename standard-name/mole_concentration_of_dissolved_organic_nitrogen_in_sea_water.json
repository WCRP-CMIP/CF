  "description": "\"Mole concentration\" means number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction \"mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". \"Dissolved organic nitrogen\" describes the nitrogen held in carbon compounds in solution. These are mostly generated by plankton excretion and decay.",
