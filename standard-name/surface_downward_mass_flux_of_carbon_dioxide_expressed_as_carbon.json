  "description": "\"Downward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward).  The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.  The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere.  The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2.",
