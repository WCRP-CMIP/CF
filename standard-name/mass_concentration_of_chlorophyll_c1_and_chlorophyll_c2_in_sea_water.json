  "description": "\"Mass concentration\" means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction \"mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species or biological group denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". Chlorophylls are the green pigments found in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria; their presence is essential for photosynthesis to take place. There are several different forms of chlorophyll that occur naturally. All contain a chlorin ring (chemical formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose structure varies. The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. Chlorophyll c1c2 (sometimes written c1-c2 or c1+c2) means the sum of chlorophyll c1 and chlorophyll c2. The chemical formula of chlorophyll c1 is C35H30MgN4O5, and chlorophyll c2 is C35H28MgN4O5. The equivalent term in the NERC P01 Parameter Usage Vocabulary may be found at http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/CHLC12PX/3/.",
