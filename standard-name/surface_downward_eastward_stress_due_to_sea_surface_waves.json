  "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. \"Surface stress\" means the shear stress (force per unit area) exerted by the wind at the surface. A downward stress is a downward flux of momentum. Over large bodies of water, wind stress can drive near-surface currents. \"Downward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). \"Eastward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward). \"Downward eastward\" indicates the ZX component of a tensor. A downward eastward stress is a downward flux of eastward momentum, which accelerates the lower medium eastward and the upper medium westward. The specification of a physical process by the phrase \"due_to_\" process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Sea surface waves\" means the stress associated with form drag over sea surface waves.",
