  "description": "\"Amount\" means mass per unit area. \"Precipitation\" in the earth's atmosphere means precipitation of water in all phases. The construction lwe_thickness_of_X_amount or _content means the vertical extent of a layer of liquid water having the same mass per unit area. The abbreviation \"lwe\" means liquid water equivalent. A spell is the number of consecutive days on which the condition X_below|above_threshold is satisfied. A variable whose standard name has the form spell_length_of_days_with_X_below|above_threshold must have a coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable with the standard name of X to supply the threshold(s). It must have a climatological time variable, and a cell_method entry for within days which describes the processing of quantity X before the threshold is applied. A spell_length_of_days is an intensive quantity in time, and the cell_methods entry for over days can be any of the methods listed in Appendix E appropriate for intensive quantities e.g. \"maximum\", \"minimum\" or \"mean\".",
