  "description": "Sea surface temperature is usually abbreviated as \"SST\". It is the temperature of sea water near the surface (including the part under sea-ice, if any). More specific terms, namely sea_surface_skin_temperature, sea_surface_subskin_temperature, and surface_temperature are available for the skin, subskin, and interface temperature. respectively. For the temperature of sea water at a particular depth or layer, a data variable of sea_water_temperature with a vertical coordinate axis should be used. It is strongly recommended that a variable with this standard name should have a units_metadata attribute, with one of the values \"on-scale\" or \"difference\", whichever is appropriate for the data, because it is essential to know whether the temperature is on-scale (meaning relative to the origin of the scale indicated by the units) or refers to temperature differences (implying that the origin of the temperature scale is irrevelant), in order to convert the units correctly (cf. https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units).",
