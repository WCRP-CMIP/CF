  "description": "Wave slope describes an aspect of sea surface wave geometry related to sea surface roughness. Mean square slope describes a derivation over multiple waves within a sea-state, for example calculated from moments of the wave directional spectrum. The phrase \"y_slope\" indicates that slope values are derived from vector components along the grid y-axis.",
