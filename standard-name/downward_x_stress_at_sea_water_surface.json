  "description": "\"Downward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward). \"x\" indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis, positive with increasing x. A downward x stress is a downward flux of momentum towards the positive direction of the model's x-axis. The phrase \"sea water surface\" means the upper boundary of the liquid portion of an ocean or sea, including the boundary to floating ice if present.",
