  "description": "The sea surface subskin temperature is the temperature at the base of the conductive laminar sub-layer of the ocean surface, that is, at a depth of approximately 1 - 1.5 millimeters below the air-sea interface. For practical purposes, this quantity can be well approximated to the measurement of surface temperature by a microwave radiometer operating in the 6 - 11 gigahertz frequency range, but the relationship is neither direct nor invariant to changing physical conditions or to the specific geometry of the microwave measurements. Measurements of this quantity are subject to a large potential diurnal cycle due to thermal stratification of the upper ocean layer in low wind speed high solar irradiance conditions. It is strongly recommended that a variable with this standard name should have a units_metadata attribute, with one of the values \"on-scale\" or \"difference\", whichever is appropriate for the data, because it is essential to know whether the temperature is on-scale (meaning relative to the origin of the scale indicated by the units) or refers to temperature differences (implying that the origin of the temperature scale is irrevelant), in order to convert the units correctly (cf. https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units).",
