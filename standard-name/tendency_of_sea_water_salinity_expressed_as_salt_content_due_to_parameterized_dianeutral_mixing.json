  "description": "The phrase \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. \"Dianeutral mixing\" means mixing across surfaces of neutral buoyancy. \"Parameterized\" means the part due to a scheme representing processes which are not explicitly resolved by the model.",
