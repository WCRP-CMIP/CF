  "description": "Surge is a displacement along an axis that is perpendicular to the local vertical axis and is coplanar with the nominal forward motion direction of the platform. Surge is relative to the \"at rest\" position of the platform with respect to the axis of displacement. The \"at rest\" position of the platform may change over time. The standard name platform_surge should be chosen only if the sign convention of the data is unknown. For cases where the sign convention of the surge is known, a standard name of platform_surge_fore or platform_surge_aft should be chosen, as appropriate. A \"platform\" is a structure or vehicle that serves as a base for mounting sensors. Platforms include, but are not limited to, satellites, aeroplanes, ships, buoys, instruments, ground stations, and masts.",
