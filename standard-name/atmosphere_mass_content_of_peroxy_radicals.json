  "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including \"content_of_atmosphere_layer\" are used. The term \"peroxy_radicals\" means all organic and inorganic peroxy radicals. This includes HO2 and all organic peroxy radicals, sometimes referred to as RO2. In chemistry, a \"radical\" is a highly reactive, and therefore short lived, species.",
