  "description": "\"moisture\" means water in all phases contained in soil. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The \"soil content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface down to the bottom of the soil model. For the content between specified levels in the soil, standard names including content_of_soil_layer are used.
