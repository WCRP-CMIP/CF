  "description": "\"Natural grasses\" means grasses growing in areas of low productivity, often situated on rough or uneven ground. This can include rocky areas, briars and heathland. A \"c4 plant\" is one that utilizes the C4 carbon fixation pathway in which the CO2 is first bound to a compound containing four carbon atoms before photosynthesis reactions take place. All trees are C3 type. Grasses and crops can be C3 or C4."
