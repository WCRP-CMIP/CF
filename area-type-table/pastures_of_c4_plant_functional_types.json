  "description": "Pastures are assumed to be anthropogenic in origin. They include anthropogenically managed pastureland and rangeland. A \"c4 plant\" is one that utilizes the C4 carbon fixation pathway in which the CO2 is first bound to a compound containing four carbon atoms before photosynthesis reactions take place. All trees are C3 type. Grasses and crops can be C3 or C4."
